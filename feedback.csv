1,"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",neutral
2,"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on.",neutral
3,Hard class ,neutral
4,He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.,neutral
5,"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!",neutral
6,"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else.",neutral
7,"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can.",neutral
8,"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman.",neutral
9,"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature.",neutral
10,This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.,neutral
11,"hes pretty tough, expects too much",neutral
12,"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. Farm will help you, but the key to this course is to use  math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible.",neutral
13,"Mr. Farm is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A.",neutral
14,"Mr. Farm is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one.",neutral
15,He will answer all the questions you have. And he is willing to give his students a second chance to take passed due hw. Random in class quizzes is easy!,neutral
16,"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples.",neutral
17,"Farm has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part.  His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class.",neutral
18,"Mr. Farm is the nicest man you will ever meet. His concepts are easy to figure out. As long as you pay attention and show up, you will be fine.",neutral
19,Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!,neutral
20,"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended.",neutral
21,"Mr. Farm is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams.",neutral
22,"Mr. Farm knows math and he wants you to learn.  Don't expect him to just give you the answers. He will answer any and every question and clarify anything you need.  Attend class, do the assignments and you'll do fine.  Gives 2 tests (10 questions each) and final (15 questions). Super nice, nerdy guy who's motto is 'Math on!' ",neutral
23,  He tries his best to make sure everyone gets the help they need.  He tries to make lecture fun. He gives a lot of homework but will extend deadline to the amount of time you need to get done.  He is a good guy.,neutral
24,"Mr. Farm was always willing to help, he just requires you put in the work.  I was never a fan of math until I took his class. You can ask him fifty questions and he will do his best to answer you. Depending on the class he does lots of assignments or little quizes. I would highly recommend him. Attendance is not required but helps a lot!",neutral
25,"This guy is genuinely there for his students and is willing to help.  I ended the class with 101% in the class, so getting an A isn't an impossible feat.. I suggest doing the all assignments, the study guides, and getting Calc. for dummies, which was a HUGE help for me. DON'T GET THE TEXTBOOK, I NEVER USED IT. PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS.",neutral
26,"The class is difficult, so you will not pass by just attending class and expecting to absorb the information. If you don't put in effort outside of class then you are preparing to fail. Stuart is sometimes hard to follow, but he offers many opportunities to seek help, and he cares about his students. Even though he is goofy, he's a really good guy.",neutral
27,"He might not be the clearest lecturer in the world but he is the absolute BEST one-on-one teacher I had in my four years at UND.  He's so encouraging and genuinely wants his students to do well.  If you're not willing to spend time on the homework & go to his office hours then you probably won't get a good grade, but that's your own fault.",neutral
28,"Extremely difficult class, but a requirement. That being said, even with all the bad reviews Farm knows what he's doing. His classes are difficult to follow and I wouldnt have passed with just attendance. He was available whenever I needed to ask him questions, and once responded to an email of mine at 4:30am. Dont know if I would pass without him",neutral
29,"Mr farm is a really nice guy but he is a very hard teacher. He takes the majority of class time showing you how to get a FORMULA. then there is only a short time to learn how to use the actual formula. I got A's on all my maths tests in highschool, out of four this year i got one B and the rest are lower then that. good luckk.",neutral
30,Very Helpful and Easy to get help from. Tests are kind of hard but he gives you review sheets. Overall good teacher,neutral
31,He is a very nice guy. Alot of people do not like him because of his grading but if you go in for help he will help you! Also the online homework is very easy and will help. He is a very nice man!,neutral
32,"This guy lectures well but he is so soft spoken that it is imperative to sit right in front to hear him properly. The online homework took me a long time since I was new to Calculus, but it is the best way to learn the material. At one point he provided evidence to support Noah's flood and Earth's age which was a misuse of his position.",neutral
33,Dorky at times but a good teacher,neutral
34,"I thought Mr. Farm was an excellent PreCalculus instructor.  One of the best math teachers I've had.  He does a great job at explaining the concepts and providing examples on the blackboard.  Also, I thought he was mildly entertaining and has a friendly demeanor, which never hurts.",neutral
35,He is very helpful if you don't understand the topic. Sometimes the tests can be tricky but if you go in for his office hours he is more than happy to explain the concepts for you.,neutral
36,Best math teacher I've ever had! Definitely taking one of his classes again.,neutral
37,"Best math teacher I've ever had.  He's really helpful and accomodating.  Hes also really easy to talk to, dont hesitate to go talk to him about problems on a test.  If you go to class regularly, take notes and DO the homework, there is absolutly no reason you shouldnt get an A.",neutral
38,"Farm wasn't that bad...VERY easy to talk to...yes test were hard, but speak up! if you say something he will try and fix it...he fixed 2 tests we had because we expressed concern...he really does want to work with you...",neutral
39,I don't see why everyone has such a problem with him.  I like his teaching style and you learn quite a bit from it.  Take the class from him if you actually want to learn and not fall behind for the next Calc class.  He's helpful and accomodating after class also..,neutral
40,"I would not consider this class a sociology class. This felt more like just information on drugs and did not talk about it sociologically. It was still a good class, a lot harder than any other class by Frank White. Online quizzes for every test which are easy. You cannot skip this class ever.",neutral
41,Great professor! Manages to entertain a whole lecture hall when he teaches. Hilarious and will always keep your attention.,neutral
42,"Frank's easily one of the best professors at UND and goes out of his way to get to know his students. Knows all the course content extremely well, and keeps you engaged the whole time. Some of his stories are awesome. Do the memory matrices, crosswords, and study guides and you'll easily pass. Go to class because his powerpoints are fill in.",neutral
43,"Frank is easily one of the most knowledgeable professors at UND. He's also incredibly likable and approachable, and his lectures are genuinely interesting.",neutral

45,"Frank White is the BEST professor at UND. He can turn the most boring topic into something that you're literally on the edge of your seat to hear. He's extremely knowledgeable and up-to-date on his material, genuinely cares about his students, and takes the time to get to know them. He's got a great sense of humor  and is well respected by everyone",neutral
46,"Great class, great teacher. He does use power points now. Either use your computer to fill in the notes or print out the power points and bring them to class to fill in the rest of the lecture notes.",neutral
47,"Interesting and entertaining.  Instructor makes this class a pleasure and is very high energy.  He was always willing to answer questions and provide assistance and was happy to have engaged students.  Even if you aren't a SOC major, take this class!",neutral
48,"Funny, interesting, and helpful! Definitely recommend Dr. White! He gets to know his students (which is amazing that he knows so many in such a large lecture) and enjoys what he does!",neutral
49,"Frank is one of the best teachers at UND. It's sad that he's now done with the big lecture classes, because otherwise I'd highly recommend you take them. Intro to Soc. was extremely easy anyway, but he made going to class fun and that made the class awesome.",neutral
50,Most interesting prof. I've ever had. Even if you're not interested in the material his lectures will get you listening. Attendance is pretty much required with easy daily quizzes but it was honestly never a struggle to convince myself to go to this class. Definitely take at least one class from him.,neutral
51,He's such an awesome professor. He has passion for what he teaches and makes things interesting to us. He uses funny examples all the time that are sure to get a laugh out of you. I HIGHLY recommend taking this class from him.,neutral
52,"Frank is by far one of the best teachers at UND. Lectures are very entertaining, and he has a fun sense of humor and great story-telling ability. Posts online memory matrices, review information, and a lecture outline to guide students. Highly recommend taking the class.",neutral
53,Frank White was a great professor! I looked forward to going to class because Frank was funny and outgoing during lectures and passionate toward what he was teaching. The tests were not to bad as long as you went to class and studied for them.,neutral
54,"One of the best teachers i've ever had, all his classes are lecture based, he has a funny story for every topic he is talking about. Made coming to class fun. Highly recommended",neutral
55,"Such a great professor.  He made and effort to get to know me personally.  Also, he makes class very interesting.  He talks about personal stories to help you understand the material.",neutral
56,"AMAZING professor. He is the reason I switched my major to Sociology. Always attend class because he does not put notes online. If you can, bring your laptop for notes. He jumps around a lot and fills in things he missed during his lecture so it's easiest to use your computer and he doesn't use powerpoint.",neutral
57,"Very interesting, has stories for everything. Doesn't use powerpoint which makes class much more interactive but make sure to take notes because most of the exam is based off of class. Best professor I've had at UND and very approachable",neutral
58,"He was a great professor! If you take the time to talk to him and get to know him it will benefit you in the end.  Go to class though and pay attention, he doesn't put the notes online and he talks really fast! But overall he makes class interesting!",neutral
59,Frank is the best professor I've had. If you go to class and take the notes (he doesn't put them on powerpoint) it's an easy A. He tells funny stories and makes class really interesting.,neutral
60,Very entertaining.  Keeps you engaged! He connects things to real world stuff so it's easy to understand which makes the tests easy!,neutral
61,EXCELLENT teacher. if you are taking sociology take it from him. He is very funny and entertaining. you have to attend class or you wont have the notes for the tests which are 70% off of lecture notes. the other 30% is from the book which you have to read. he gives a study guide which is very helpful.,neutral
62,"He is definitely the best professor I have had so far. He is really funny and personable and makes the class interesting. But, you need to go to class to get the notes because he doesnt put them up on blackboard and most of the test is based off lecture. Easy A if you go.",neutral
63,"helpful , made the class interesting",neutral
64,he is the best teacher I have had at UND so far. he loves his job and wants you to learn. there is never a bad lecture.,neutral
65,"Very passionate in his lecture, and likes to make the class laugh.  he always talks to people before class starts just to see how their day is going.  The only negative is that he does not use powerpoints so you have to write everything down.  He talks very fast too, so either learn how to type/write quickly.",neutral
66,Good teacher but my only complaints are he doesnt use powerpoint slides or post notes on blackboard so you have to write down everything he says and he talks fast & rambles a lot.Make friends in the class because if you miss a day you will need to get the notes from them or else you won't do that well on the tests. Do the study guides as well.,neutral
67,"By far the best professor at UND. He is so passionate about his students and his career.  Going to class was always a blast, and almost every seat was always filled.",neutral
68,lectures are very interesting and helpful in understanding textbook,neutral
69,Hilarious and very interesting! I love this class and White really knows his stuff. Every lecture is entertaining. Labs are pointless though,neutral
70,THIS GUY IS HILARIOUS AND DEFINATELY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. BY FAR THE BEST SOCIOLOGY TEACHER AND IS VERY EASY AND FUN TO LISTEN TO,neutral
71,I had this guy for a professor some years ago and I remember him doing a fantastic job.  His lectures were smooth and fast moving as he demonstrated an outstanding grasp of the material.  Easily one of the top three professors I've encountered in my college time.,neutral
72,AWESOME LECTURER! totally hilarious and keeps your attention guaranteed.  His classes are kind of random facts thrown together but review sheets help extremely on tests.  TA's are either awesome or insanely stuck up.... so beware. Lab homework is tedious but very easy.,neutral
73,One of the best professors at UND.  His lectures are humorous; not boring or &quot;death by power point.&quot;,neutral
74,"Far and away the best Prof at UND. Funny as hell, great teacher, and cares for his students. Sometimes his class is like watching a stand-up comic.  Take any class you can, you will not regret it.",neutral
75,Frank's lectures are very interesting and they are also very easy to understand.  He also makes learning easy  by connecting stories to his lectures.,neutral
76,"AWESOME teacher.  Very dynamic and makes the class very interesting.  I would take another class I don't find interesting at all, as long as he teaches it because he's such a great teacher.",neutral
77,Such a funny class!  Cant get over the accent.  His stories are so damn funny and they help you relate real life with the course teachings.  Take anything with this teacher,neutral
78,"Frank is easily the best teacher I've had in my 3 years of college.  He really does seem to enjoy teaching and seems like a very genuinely caring guy.  Anyone looking to take this course, rest assured that you have an excellent professor in charge.  Again, one of the best teachers UND has.",neutral

82,"Frank has a way with the students, he is not just there because thats what he is suppose to do but I believe that he has passion in what he does which brings excitement to his class. Love the stories, they help me relate, when I study for his class it is so much easier when I have the stories to remember and fall back on.",neutral

91,Made the class very interesting. Loved his stories!,neutral
92,one of the best lecturers I have ever seen.,neutral
93,Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,neutral
94,"This has by far been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life but it is SO worth it. The class is time consuming and a good grade doesn't come easy. You have to be determined and have to put a lot of time and effort into the course, but Dr. Shively isn't out to make people fail, he wants you to pass, you just have to READ the Q's.",neutral
95,"Shively is the man. He really knows his stuff. This class with the lab was easily the hardest course I've ever taken. If you aren't constantly reading the chapters, spending a couple of nights a week in lab you're not going to get an A. That being said it is possible. Super funny guy, really cares about his students, but he'll make you work for it.",neutral
96,"Dr. Shively is the best professor I've ever had. He helped me to UNDERSTAND and LOVE the material rather than just memorize it. He is willing to work with you outside of class and he cares about your success. This course is the tough and requires a lot of effort. But if you are willing to work REALLY hard and put in the hours, an A is possible!",neutral
97,"If you have to take Anatomy, take it from Shively! He's honestly the best lecture teacher available. He has funny stories he'll tell and he loves it when students ask questions. This is a very hard class but I could tell Shively wanted his students to succeed, he just expects you to use your brain and actually do the work and reading!!",neutral
98,"I enjoyed Dr Shively, but this class is a little ridiculous.  The anatomy department acts like their class is a gift from the gods. I am in nursing school now and am annoyed that the correct anatomical terms I spent so much time learning in this class aren't used in the medical field - I have to learn the 'improper' terms used in the real world.",neutral
99,"Shively taught me so much, I am so grateful I took his class. When students didn't understand, he explained the material another way. Memorize the textbook!!! He will try to help you succeed as long as you want it enough to keep trying. There is a lot of material, but I passed even though I had a concussion this semester. You can do it!",neutral
100,"Dr. Shively is the best professor I've ever had. His class is almost impossibly hard, but he designs it that way on purpose. If you go to him for help, he won't just 'help you out' by giving you good grades, but he will do everything he can to help you really learn anatomy. He's also one of the kindest and most hilarious people I've ever met.",neutral
101,"Dr. Shively is hilarious and I honestly loved his class. However it was seriously one of the hardest things I've ever done (because of the course material, not the teacher).  Lots of reading, and the tests were very tricky (but the whole anatomy department uses the same tests). The expected averages were in the 50's and 60's (the curve is magical).",neutral
102,"Dr. Shively is a character. That being said, he really wants his students to succeed. He is a kind-hearted person and really knows his material.  Be prepared to study a lot. His online videos are extremely helpful. Totally possible to earn an A but you will work hard.",neutral
103,"2325 too. This has been by far the hardest class I've taken, but I'm glad I took it from Shively because I have learned SO much and I've enjoyed learning it all. He is a nice guy and always answers my questions. It's a hard class but it needs to be. If you're not good at spelling, get good at it before taking this class from anyone at UVU.",neutral
104,Dr. Shively is a great teacher.  He has lectures that he has filmed that are available online.  They were extremely helpful.   I liked that he broke things down in a simple way so I could understand. His tests were really hard. He will tell u whats on the test. The learning objectives packet will be your saving grace when it comes to studying.,neutral
105,"Yes, the tests are hard, it's a lot of work, but it's the most rewarding class ever. Shively is GREAT in lecture because he gives you simple definitions. The best textbook I've ever had. Grading is rough, but you'll understand why. He lets you know what you do need to know and in how much detail. He comes off scary but he's hilarious & very sweet. ",neutral
106,"Awesome class! Prepares you well for med school. Those who bag on this class obviously don't try hard enough to pass. Shively was a great professor, so funny and willing to help you out and clarify  concepts. Such a great class, lab was so fun!",neutral
107,"Shively's Intro to Anatomy class kinda felt more like an Intro Med School class. People on here are not kidding when they say it's difficult! You NEED the textbook to pass. All I can say is STUDY STUDY STUDY. If you do poorly on one test (of his five or so) he will let you replace one with the final. Go to class, read your notes, read the text. ",neutral
108,"Shively is a unique fellow. I like him. He knows what he's talking about. He wrote the book on anatomy, literally.  The textbook anyway. The subject is tough, there is a lot to learn. He won't dumb it down, so if you're not putting in enough effort you won't pass the class. Shively does do his best to motivate his students and help them understand",neutral
109,"Difficult class. It takes a lot of time and effort. One of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. If you enjoy learning, you will love this class. If you want an easy 'A' don't take it.",neutral

111,"Difficult class. Takes a lot of time and effort. (40+ hours a week) It has been one of the most rewarding classes ever taken. If you have any questions, all you need to do is ask. Also he is willing to meet with you if you contact him and set an appointment.",neutral
112,Great teacher! Dr. Shively is legit! He says exactly what he means and follows through. He tells you exactly what you need to do in order to succeed. DO IT! Read the book. DO THE OBJECTIVES! Read the clinicals. Yeah it's hard. So make sure you work hard! Don't under estimate this class but it will be the best class if you put in the work required.,neutral
113,Best teacher for subject of anatomy. Always willing to help and explain subject matter. If you do the required work you will succeed .,neutral
114,"Let me set the record straight: You will be fine in this class if you DO THE OBJECTIVES, STUDY THE REVIEW QUESTIONS, AND DO STUDY THE OUTLINE IN THE BOOK.  It's hard material,but Shively does a great job of helping you understand, but you need to study the book!  He'll help you if you work hard.  You'll love the class if you do!",neutral
115,Doctor Shively is an amazing professor. The best I have had at UVU. Anatomy is a very hard class but Doc makes it clear what you need to know. Very clear and wants students to succeed and learn. His tests are difficult but ultimately really help you learn. Overall I really enjoyed this class although it was extremely hard.,neutral
116,Shively is awesome! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Super helpful and kind. Knows everything about the subject. Willing to help outside of class or answer any question without making you feel dumb. Work hard-get a good study partner. Study exactly what he tells you from the book. An A is totally possible!!,neutral
117,"Dr. Shively is AWESOME!! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Requires A LOT to get an A, but it's worth it. Study exactly what he says-don't just memorize-understand it well enough to explain it to someone else. Get a good study partner and work like you've never worked and you'll get SO much out of it. One complaint-doesn't use Canvas!",neutral
118,"People whine and moan about this class, but that's because you have to WORK HARD in this class, and people are not committed, or they are too lazy.

119,HARDEST class I have ever LOVED. Be 110% committed and you will get an A. Dr. Shively is more than willing to help if you just ask!,neutral
120,good teacher but the hardest class you will take,neutral
121,"This class is not an easy class.  Shively expects more than just memorization.  He wants students to think critically about the material.  Once you realize he expects more than memorization, it makes the class more bearable and interesting.  He's a good instructor, though not the most helpful one on one.",neutral
122,"HArdest class you will ever take... That being said, also the most rewarding. Shively is the man! Great teacher, definetely teaches you to think things through. Combo of him and homan was best learning experience I have had at uvu. Dedicate EVERYTHING to this class, and an A is possible",neutral
123,Shively's Anatomy is about the hardest class you can take at UVU. He is very good at explaining things and knows almost everything about the subject. His tests are very difficult due to the wording of his questions and the vast amount of information you need to know. He is willing to help if asked. If you want to know the subject well take it here.,neutral
124,"Shively is actually an awesome teacher, but demanding.  Study what he tells you to, but know it backwards and forwards.  Questions are tricky.  I earned an A w/o curve.  I know from friends grades that the curve is very generous.  This was my only class and I wasn't working, so it was my life.  It was hard, but I feel prepared for PA school.",neutral
125,"If you've heard this is the hardest class you will take, you're right! But it will be the most rewarding class you will ever take. I'm in nursing school right now, and thanks to Shively i know my stuff forward and backward. I got an A with the curve but i dedicated my life to Anatomy! Good Luck, but be prepared to eat, sleep, breath Anatomy!",neutral
126,"The trio of professors; Shively, Holman, and Bracken, shaped my love for human science. I am now a biomed engineering student which requires a rigorous attention to detail. Bracken helped teach how to think. Shively underlined the importance of being meticulous.  Holman instilled passion and taught me that med school is not the answer to everything",neutral
127,"Dr. Shively has taught for so long that his lectures seem to be memorized, so everything on the tests is mentioned in class. However, that does not mean they are easy at all. The average was in the 30s. You will learn a lot, and if you study you should do fine. In a way his class tests more on ability to answer trick questions than on knowledge.",neutral
128,"Read the book extensively.  Obj's, Q's @ back of book, and ask things in class.  Well above avg on quizzes, C on final and got A.  Dr. Shively is demanding, but thorough and kind. DO xtra credit!",neutral
129,"Dr. Shively is amazing! The class is hard, but you get a lot out of it. I am hoping for an amazing curve so I can pass. Best day ever when he plays the guitar.

131,"It's been a few yrs since I took this class, but b/c of this man I aced my med school Anatomy class. All the rumors that this is the hardest class you'll ever take are completely true. But that being said, med school anatomy was a cake walk after going through this class! So if you really planning on going into medicine, this is the class to take.",neutral
132,"Dr. Shively is an excellent teacher- the fact that he and prof. Homan wrote their own books shows their commitment to their profession.  He is extremely knowledgeable and does a great job at pushing his students to truly think of solutions that we may face in our future.  Overall, read the book, do the practice questions- and learn how he asks Q's.",neutral
133,One of my faviorite teachers at UVU. I enjoyed his class even though it was difficult. Very helpful if you ask and make sure you take time to meet with him.,neutral
134,"VERY possible to do well in this class. Those who are complaining either don't know how to study or didn't put in enough time. The info is straightforward there's just a lot to learn. Doc will answer any question you have. Spent over an hour with me outside class answering questions. If your'e going into the medical field, take this class at UVU.",neutral
135,"Many hate Dr. Shively but I really like him and the tests teach you to actually think. All tests from other teachers are a cinch after this. Work hard, don't fall behind or you'll never catch up. Expect to have no social life, live in the lab, read the text, always go to class, get into study groups! Read text before class and ask questions.",neutral
136,"How well you do in this class is a big indicator of what kind of person you are.  If you procrastinate, don't have basic study discipline, and if you just go through the motions--you will hate this professor, because he actually expects you to do something called work.  Welcome to college.",neutral
137,"Dr. Shively is smart, and his class (and tests) are HARD but you probably already heard. He's a good teacher who knows his stuff, buckle down and learn how to study or wuss out and go somewhere else for this class. My favorite day was when he brought in his guitar.",neutral
138,"At the end of this class you will have mastered critical thing as well as anatomy.  His tests and quizzes are the hardest I've taken, but you really know the stuff. IF you want to be good at your profession, take anatomy at UVU, if you just want to get a good grade then take it at slcc, and please don't be my doctor! In all, I do love anatomy now.",neutral
139,"One of my favorite professors, his classes are tough, so no easy grade.  I think if you really try you will find he has a lot to offer as an instructor.",neutral
140,"Shively is the funniest professor I've ever had. He's excellent at explaining all the concepts clearly. His quizzes and tests are insanely hard, but he grades on a curve so it's easy to get a good grade. My only complaint is that I had no idea what my grade was til after the course ended. But anyone who says stay away just didn't work hard enough.",neutral
141,"Dr. Shivley knows his stuff and helps you learn it as well, but when it comes to the tests you have a better chance of doing well if you dont even study. His quizzes are by far the most tricky I have ever seen. And the most difficult. Anatomy is a great class and Shivley is a good teacher but be prepared to work your butt of and to have NO LIFE oth",neutral
142,"This is a VERY hard class. Definitely not an easy a. Shively is a hilarious teacher and explains things well. Of all the anatomy teachers, he's the best!",neutral
143,"this is an intense class, but you will learn your stuff. Treat this class like a full time job. Dr Shivley is brillent! he makes the best analogies, it really helped me in understanding certain processes. I highly highly recommend this professor!",neutral
144,"The expectations for this class are unreal. The test questions are very hard, & test you on how well you read them rather than the material. His lectures don't really prepare you, but the material in the textbook does. That being said, Dr. Shively is an extremely nice & helpful man. I would definitely recommend him over other lecture instructors.",neutral
145,Very intelligent guy and knows his stuff well! Be sure to keep up in the reading and his study guide that he gives out and ask a lot of questions. Also ALWAYS check the answers you got wrong on quizzes. Sometimes there were things on the quiz that I had never heard of so it is good to go back and clarify with him. He also grades on a curve.,neutral

147,"Dr Shively is great.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but you learn a lot.  READ THE TEXT!  I went to class everyday, but a lot of what he teaches is in the text and a good chunk of what he doesn't!  Know the questions at the end of the chapter!  Draw the pictures he draws in lecture.  He's funny, and easy to listen to.",neutral
148,"He's funny and a good teacher you just have to pay attention and take notes, I rarely read the book and didn't always do too great on the quizzes but if you do well in lab you'll be fine it does take up quite a bit of time but its interesting",neutral
149,"Plan on this class taking a lot of your time, you'll be studying all the time. I really enjoyed the class and feel that I learned so much. Go to the open labs, do all the homework, and study!!",neutral
150,Shively is a really good teacher in that he knows his material. The class demands A LOT of time but its not hard to get a a good grade. just make sure to STUDY THE QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK! most times the test questions are exactly like them.,neutral
151,"The assigned textbook was completely useless, study off the one he wrote and you'll be setting the curve. I love this teacher, he knows so much! I'm taking another one of this classes next.",neutral
152,"Dr. Shivley is awesome. He is difficult but it will prepare you for any health related course you plan on taking. STUDY, READ, GO TO OPEN LAB and You'll do fine. Take anatomy from him. All the people who give poor ratings just didn't put in the time.",neutral
153,"This class is very frustrating.  His tests are so hard that getting an &quot;F&quot; on a test is good.  That's a problem in my mind.  If you can't or aren't willing to put ALL your time into this class, then don't take it from him!  I have no problem in working hard and studying hard to succeed, but his class is beyond rediculous.  Don't take it from him.",neutral
154,"Difficult, yes, but he tells you where test questions will come from--the questions in his book.  Know the answers to those questions and you will be fine.  Best professor I've had (I went to UVU and graduated at UofU).  I am more proud of doing well in this class than any other--it was the hardest class I had.",neutral
155,I have done a huge disservice to myself by not giving this class the time it requires to do well.  I have children and only arranged daycare for the time I was in lab and lecture.  I should have put them in all day and treated this summer class like a full time job.  Had I done this I would be a lot less stressed out.  Don't make my mistake!,neutral
156,"I wanted an A and got one by having a study group, going to as many open labs as I could, reading the books, by not getting discouraged and staying motivated. Shively is always walking around school just waiting for students to bump into him and ask him a question. Hard class but worth it because you get a thorough tour of the human body!",neutral
157,"Plus- Shively is extremely knowledgable. He understands what he is talking about.He offers to help you outside of class. He can be quite hilarious at times.Minus- the test are indredibly hard and on top of that, Shively is always making mistakes so they have to be rekeyed.Students would learn more if tests were not so hard. Bonus- grades on a curve",neutral
158,"This class is difficult, but I learned soooooo much. Shively's quizzes are really hard, but as long as you do as poorly as everyone else, you'll pass. I loved his lectures, even though I was scared to death the first week or so. Don't put things off in this class or you will be sorry. Shively is extremely smart and willing to help you out.",neutral
159,"This class takes up your life!! Be prepared to wear around your under eye circles.. his quizzes are as obscure as his mind...he's very intelligent, but you have to think like he does during test time. he's hilarious and I made really good friends for the lab on this class.  I suggest to NEVER PROCRASTINATE in this class.",neutral
160,"Hmm, will I have an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;D&quot;&#63; A very common question among his students.          This class is extremely time consuming, and most times very frustrating. Don't let your score of 25% fool you, it might actually be the class high on a test. Very hard teacher, but rather entertaining. Take his classes with other EASY classes! or else!!",neutral
161,Don't let his relaxed in class attitude fool you! Yes his lectures are fun and he is entertaining- but his tests will rock your world if you haven't read EVERYTHING in the test! Curve is the only way people pass so stay on top of it!,neutral
162,I cannot believe how much people complain and moan about this class!!.  Yes it is very hard and challenging but you are given everything you need to succeed.  Absolutely fantastic teacher!!!!,neutral
163,"Amazing teacher! He is very smart and his tests are challenging. There is a curve at the end, but you still need to work hard. It can be an imtimidating class when you first start because its a lot of information to cover in a lower division class, but if your going into the medical field or grad school its worth it. Good Luck!",neutral
164,"It makes me laugh to see everybody complaining about Dr. Shively. He is one of the best instructors I have ever had, and is very fair. He even curved my whole class up 25 points at the end of the semester.  If you can't get a good grade with a 25% boost, you shouldn't be a science major.",neutral
165,"If you are looking to go into anything w/ the medical field you need to take Shivley's class! It is hard, but if you study hard you will do fine. He's a great teacher and very funny.",neutral
166,"He is a very good teacher, his quizzes are extreamly hard though. This is not a class that you can just slide by in. You have to put in tons of time and effort.  He is very helpful, and cares about his students so much! He wants us to do well, and understands that his class is very hard. He wants us to really know our stuff. Great but hard teacher",neutral
167,One of the top two professors of my college experience.  Dr. Shively cares about helping students learn.  He is one of the few teachers at UVU that pushes his students because he wants them to realize their potential.  He is extremely fair with his grading and anyone who says otherwise didn't put the time or effort into the class.,neutral
168,For all of those who say this class is unfair and too hard...you probably didn't put in the necessary amount time.  Doc Shively is an extremely good teacher and he is very clear about you need to know for his tests.  I recommend taking this class with a &quot;lighter load&quot; or during the summer because you do need to put in the time to be successful!!,neutral
169,"it is a good class, but just be prepared to work at it like crazy!!!! I really think Shively is a good teacher, but he is a hard one, so don't go into it expecting a mildly challenging class! study his book CAREFULLY. his tests are hard, but after a while you can start to see how he writes them and study for them accordingly and ASK QUESTIONS",neutral
170,"Easy class.  Take good notes, study throughout the semester to avoid the big push at the end.  I studied maybe 1 hour a week, and 5 hours the week before the final and got an A even before the 20 point curve.",neutral
171,"Dr. Shively makes this class simple. He is very specific about what will and won't be on the tests, and explains things very well.",neutral
172,"Shively is AWESOME! Absolutely loved the class! I am not an extremely smart person, but put forth the effort, and got an A in the class. I don't get how people say he is unfair. Its those people who are trying to get out of studying and get an easy A. Study, devote your life to it and you'll do fine. I HIGHLY recommend Shively! He was the BEST!!!:)",neutral
173,He is just way too smart for his own good.I stuied my butt off and I still did terrible. You learn a lot but still do crappy on the tests. This class was way too hard for being an intro class.,neutral
174,"Shively is a great instructor and really knows his stuff. His quizzes are pretty difficult but not impossible to get a good score on. Use good, I'm mean very good test taking skills but studying hard is the key and don't get discouraged. Also, take advantage of every opportunity that he gives for extra credit. It will pay off",neutral
175,"He's super hard, but knows everything! really awesome guy!",neutral
176,"Love this professor- lectures are humorous, informative and interesting with anecdotes designed to clarify and stick.  Tests are the devil, the wording is tricky, requires more knowledge than was given or contained in the book.  But, big curve at the end (I averaged high 50's, low 60's, & got an A.)  Still, love Shively- great guy.",neutral
177,"Make sure to take all easy classes if you are going to take this class. This was the hardest introduction class I have taken. Lectures are awesome, he knows his anatomy and he is always keeping the mood light in the classroom. Tests and quiz's are impossible to do good on. Take the class and study hard. Major curve at the end.",neutral

185,"No matter who you take it from, anatomy is not an easy class.  Shively is very entertaining and makes lectures fun to go to.  He is very interested in his students and tries to know everyone by name.  If you do you part and study your butt off you'll love this class!",neutral
186,"THis guy is an effective teacher, however, his course is quite demanding on time and effort to pass with a semi-decent grade. I work full time and do not have 30 hours  of study time to put in to this freakin class.",neutral
187,"I heard this was the hardest class ever.  I got an A, but there was a lot of memorizing, but what the hell do you expect when you learn anatomy.  Doc Shively was great!  WAY FREAKIN SMART, and knows his stuff!!  When you figure out how he tests the tests are easy if you study a little!  Great teacher though this class was great!",neutral
188,"his class is hard but if you have to take anatomy, take if from the best. he writes the test for the other anatomy teachers so you might as well get the info from the source. be prepared to hate yourself and do NOT take other hard classes with this schedule. theres only so much time to eat, sleep and study uvsc anatomy.",neutral
189,"He is the most amazing teacher you can ask for.  He has a ton of students every semester, but he tries to help you individually with any questions.  You have to spend a lot of time studying, but its an amazing subject and totally worth it.  Anyone who says different is a total whiner.",neutral
190,"Dr Shively is a good teacher, and I did learn a lot.  My one complaint is that he seems to really enjoy trying to trick you on his tests. As mentioned in other ratings, be prepared to work your tail off.",neutral

So quit spending dad's dollar and put your face in a book. You get what you earn. Dr. Shively is the best teacher I've had yet. Very helpful with any question, any time!",neutral
193,"Dr. Shively is awesome. He makes class so interesting. This class is really hard, but I learned so much. It's not impossible to get a good grade as long as you put lots of time into studying. I'm not a straight-A student, and I came out of this class with an A. Just make sure you're ready to work your butt off.",neutral
194,I liked this class but was not easy.  Shively is by far the best teacher on the subject.,neutral
195,The only reason Dr. Shively's students don't get high scores is because the tests and quizzes only include 25 and 50 questions each. He is very interested in helping his students and a lot of extra points have been added to tests lately.,neutral
196,"Amazing teacher, But you have to know how to study, those that say he's a bad teacher just aren't mature enough to know what is expected with a real teacher.",neutral
197,Excellent teacher!,neutral
198,"This is the best class at UVSC. Don't listen to anyone that tells you it's hard -- as long as you can memorize, you'll be fine. There's a ton of material, but nothing is difficult to understand. Shively & Homan are AWESOME. You DO have to live at school to get an A though, so be ready for 12hr study-sessions!",neutral
199,"Wow, really really hard class- but all the anatomy teachers are the same, they have to be so take it from the man, Shively!  He knows his stuff.  Be prepared for no social life- I was at school from 9am-midnight almost everyday but it paid off cause i got an A, it's not impossible!  Good luck!",neutral
200,"Doc is probably the best teacher at UVSC. He isn't easy and bad study habits die a hard and painful death with him. I retook the class after an E that woke me up from apathy, got an A. But I put it all on the line. The book, blue study guide and engage him all the time worked for me and my group. Can not recommend him enough.",neutral
201,Dr. Shively is the best teacher I have ever come across.  The class actually tests your capabilities.  If you want a professor that is passionate and wants you to succeed than I would definitely take it from him.  If you put in a good attitude expecting it to take alot of work than you will come out satisfied.,neutral
202,"Shively is a wonderful teacher! No the class is not easy..  This class will make you think, by the time the semester is over you will really  know your stuff. He is willing to answer your questions   even on his time. If you do the reading, ask questions & study hard. You will do great!  If you don't do these things the class will kick your  rear!!",neutral

206,"Dr. Shively is a great teacher.  He makes things interesting and has a great sense of humor.  The only problem are his tests, which are very frustrating because he tries to trick you.  I guess that is good for weeding out the bad pre-med students, but too drastic for intro to anatomy",neutral
207,He is very nice and willing to take time to help any of students.  Super smart.,neutral
208,"Want a hard but fun anatomy class&#63;  Take it from the MAN.  Shively is one of the few respected teachers at UVSC!  Take that Dr. Parker!  Shively spends alot of time with the students and has built a very nice anatomy course!  Hard, but worth it if u go into grad school!",neutral
209,This is the best teacher ever!!! This is a very hard class because everyone wants their doctor/nurse who's working on them to know their stuff.  Shively is a walking dictionary.  Who better to learn from than the man who knows it all!  He really makes it fun!,neutral
210,No Comments,neutral

213,"Dr. Shively is the only anatomist on on this side of the country.  He wrote the book so the tests are really hard.  If you're going into medicne, take anatomy from him.  He helped me decide on a career in the medicne field.",neutral
214,No Comments,neutral
215,"Go to class, take the pre-lecture quizzes, and do the extra credit he offers!  He even posts exam practices that are pretty much the same as his exams, so there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to be prepared for them.  This class is graded heavily on exams, so if you study and make sure you understand the concepts then you'll be fine.",neutral

217,"I'm reviewing Bio, though I also took ornithology from him, since I think it's more applicable. He will expect you to put in effort and respect his field. The class will not be easy, but totally possible and you will learn more than you ever have from a class! He loves birds and butterflies so take upper division from him if you get a chance!",neutral
218,"Whaley's class is tough, but worth it. You have to read the chapters before you come to class and study a lot outside of class. He provides more than enough resources for you to stud from however, and as long as you follow directions,  its an easy B. Dont do stuff last minute, attend class, study, attend recitation sessions and do MB = good grade.",neutral
219,"Despite what people say, Whaley is a good professor. People are mad that he doesn't spoon feed them what they need to know for his exams, well welcome to college. You have to read the book before class to understand the lecture. Clicker questions during class count as a test score. He wants students to understand and will help outside of class.",neutral
220,Prof. Whaley want's people to do good on tests and gives lots of time in class for questions. The key to his class is reading the text BEFORE class. All of the pre-quiz stuff comes out of the book and will really get you started on the topic. Do your vocab and make sure you know what his slides are referring to.,neutral
221,"I have no interest in biology but professor Whaley is a super nice guy. He can be condescending at first, but if you get passed that he really cares about his students and their quality of learning. Not many professors dedicate as much time to their students as he does. It wasn't an easy class, you have to read the textbook but at least you learn.",neutral
222,"Dr Whaley is a good guy that wants to help how he can. His lectures can seem unclear at times but are atleast somewhat helpful on average bc he gives similar or even exact questions on quizzes/tests. I can see why some ppl think he's condescending but his intentions are good. Just not as sensitive as some, he's an east-coaster. Easy A if you study",neutral
223,Love this Man. He really enjoys teaching upper division courses. I took him for 1610 and worked my butt off for a B. I barley put in 1 hr a week in ZOO and am getting an A. Definitely take Animal Behavior from him. Fun class and laid back grading.,neutral
224,"Professor was interesting.  However, he was knowledgeable in the field (hence PhD, though it is in Zoology).  The book was used a lot, but his tests are straight out. I would recommend attending class since he gives out a lot of tips for tests. overall: Great, just more fast-paced.",neutral
225,"Whaley is a pretty good teacher. you really have to understand the concepts to do well, you can't just regurgitate information. the tests were fairly challenging, and you do have to actually study the book and the powerpoints. he offers extra credit, which is helpful. i would definitely take another class from him.",neutral
226,"This professor was awesome! I had him a few years ago and he was tough, but I learned so much. He taught Biology 1 and 2 when I was preparing for the MCAT and I scored a 14 in Biological sciences. AWESOME. He is passionate about biology and about butterflies, and that passion shows when he teaches. It can be contagious if you will let it!",neutral
227,He is the man! He is so funny and is really helpful. You have to read the book and go to class. At the first of the semester he is kind of strait and blunt with people but as the semester goes on and you keep coming to class he likes you and is even better.,neutral
228,"Wayne is a great professor.  It has been a while since I have taken any science courses and was a little nervous for this class. If you go to class, take notes, read the chapter at least once and STUDY the STUDY GUIDES you should get an A. I would study about 1-2 hours a day.  Good Luck!",neutral
229,"I really don't understand all the negative comments about Doctor Whaley. I find him amiable, humorous, and genuinely knows his material. Sometime he can go off on tangents and forget to answer a question, but overall, I think he is a great professor.",neutral
230,"Whaley rocks! He knows his stuff, he's enthusiastic about the topic, and he's always available to help his students. Clearly if you're unwilling to put actual effort into learning you need to choose a different major.",neutral

233,"Dr. Whaley gets a bad rap.  His class is hard, but this is college.  1610 is in the top three hardest biology classes on campus.  Do homework and study!  I studied over 30 hours for the final, but I got an A dangit!.  If you want a free A change your major",neutral
234,"You dont need to print off powerpoints.do pay attention to what he says, sometimes his test questions come from random things in class. there are in class extra credit quizes. help sessions-attend! i recieved a b+ by reading each chapter 3xs. pretty much memorize book. not a bad class tho. if you cant pass this class...change your major!",neutral

236,I think he gets a bad rap. I liked him for the most part.,neutral
237,I learned a lot in his class. He gave fair warning of what would be on his test. If you study the given power points with the text book in hand you will learn the information. If you don't go to class or don't pay attention you will not do well. This is the nature of Biology.,neutral
238,"Great teacher.  Tests were not the easiest, but he made sure to cover the material and also made it clear you need to read the chapters or you have no chance.  He is one of the best teachers I have had I would take a class from him for sure",neutral
239,"Had alot to expound upon, does get behind and then rushes through to get caught up test were tricky sometimes but was fair.  Can't complain w/ an A-",neutral
240,I didn't really see anything terrible about him. I didn't think his class was that hard.  His tests have some tricky questions but I have had way harder tests than his. He is always willing to help you with whatever you don't understand and is entertaining. His big fault is he is a bit unorganized.,neutral
241,"Personally I like Whaley and his teaching methods.  He does make you work HARD for your grade though - I was taking 14 credits and studied about 50% of the time for his class.  I got a B in his class and an A in all my other classes.  Good news is, he really teaches you EVERYTHING in detail.",neutral
242,"Many people have told me that they are sorry for me when I tell them I have Whaley for bio. I don't see why I think he is fair and is teaching at the level he should. He always asks if anyone has any questions. Somewhat frantic teaching methods, but entertaining. I would take him again.",neutral

244,Goood teacher.  Really knows his stuff.  Really wants you to learn.,neutral
245,I really enjoyed Dr. Whaley's class.  His way of teaching keeps you interested in the subject.  He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to learn as much as possible.  He does enjoy butterflies and if you can get him to talk about them it's worth you while.  what a great guy.,neutral

251,You're all a bunch of ****. He's a decent teacher at least you know what he is going to test you on before each test.,neutral
252,"If you don't mind tangents, go ahead. Just be aware that if you ask too many questions on side issues, you just lost the day's lecture.",neutral
253,"Good Teacher, a bit erratic with a one-track mind.  Don't mind the spittle.",neutral
254,"Really great teacher. I don't understand all the negative ratings. Every time I had a question he would stay after with me to help me understand it. If you go, take your notes, etc you should get an A, he tries to have everyone get an A. Lectures are long but he makes them fun. Really just don't be lazy. Great guy, great teacher, great class.",neutral
255,The class is in a lecture hall so it's not super exciting. He did a good job being engaging though. It was a good review if you already know something about biology. ,neutral
256,"The test questions tend to be trick questions; he's just trying to get people to be better test-takers and read each question through thoroughly.  I personally thought the in-class clicker quizzes were the hardest.  But it's nice, because he dropped the 5 lowest assignments, quizzes,  and the lowest test.  He's good at explaining things.",neutral
257,"Dr. Parker is great teacher. He's a little odd but gives interesting and relevant metaphors to help you with concepts. Lecture based--I did not even buy a textbook. Grades are 100% quizzes and tests, which I actually liked. Take notes and you'll do well. The many negative ratings surprised me; I would definitely recommend him.",neutral
258,"This class was not at all as bad as everyone said it was. Dr. Parker is actually a really good instructor; I learned really well from him. Tests are hard, but he gives you plenty of material to help you succeed, including lecture recordings and Power Point slides. Don't fear all the negative comments on here, I really liked Dr. Parker!",neutral
259,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Dr. Parker is tough, but that's what helped me learn the material. He goes over everything really well and he spends plenty of time answering questions. He now records his lectures, provides you with all of his slides, and gives you some great materials for studying for his exams. He's loads better than people say",neutral
260,"All you have to do is go to class and listen and you'll pass.  I got a B, if I studied or did the quizzes I would've been in the A range.  Tests are there to make you think and understand the concept not make sure you can memorize.  Use the practice tests and you'll score well on the test.",neutral
261,"Professor Parker is SUPER HARD but he teaches everything you need in class. He expects you to know EVERYTHING from his class. Sometimes it is confusing but go to him and he will clear it up. FOR AN A:go to class, re-listen to his lecture till you know exactly what he say and how he says it. Test are from 80%current lect 10%past lect 10% 1610 book",neutral

263,"Parker is one of the most intelligent professors I have ever been instructed by. He shares an extensive amount of knowledge with his students.  Sure, the tests are a bit difficult but college isn't supposed to be easy. Parker always advertises his ability to help one-on-one. This class is hard, but if you actually try you can get a lot from Parker!",neutral
264,"His test is based on what he talks about in class. He posts old tests, and his power points he goes over in class all on blackboard. He explains it in a way that can be understood. he drops the lowest quiz grade, and test. I liked the way he taught, probably best teacher i have had.",neutral
265,It is just a hard class in general. He only tests on what he lectures on though. No surprises. He even posts tests from the previous semester that help a bunch with studying. He offers to sit down with each student individually to help you out if you need it.,neutral
266,"I really liked this teacher. He was very clear, and though there is a book, you don't need it. The only things on the test are from lecture. Take notes. He always reviews what last lecture was about, so it's nice if you miss. Open note/book quizzes on BB. Just go to class, take notes, and study the exam objectives. You'll at least get a B.",neutral
267,I had this professor last semester and he was awesome. For those that complain that it was hard I can only say get over it. Biology is hard and if you thought 1010 was hard wait until you get to upper biology you will kill yourself. The test were hard  but he does a good job preparing you and he does teach what is going to be on test!,neutral
268,"Biology is a difficult subject--but he did a great job explaining it.  He was always there after class if you had questions.  He also warned you what he tested on.  Those who thought this class was beyond difficult must not have realized what to expect for any biology class.  I learned a ton, but it wasn't easy.  It did help he did several quizzes.",neutral
269,"I really Liked Dr. Parker, he is a tough professor, but it does pay off especially if you want to learn something!  If your in school just to get grades don't take him.  If your here to learn, and grow, and to really become informed on the subject of biology, well then Dr. Parker is great!!",neutral
270,"He is a good teacher, and the lectures are easy to understand. He teaches what we need to know but doesn't help how to study. The lectures and study guides are unorganized. His students are responsible for making them in order & organizing to get good scores for the tests.",neutral
271,"Bruce is a nice guy, very knowledgeable about his subject, and good at explaining it.  He assigns a very light load of homework, and only does a few quizzes throughout the semester.  I do need to say though, that his tests are HARD.  He's a great teacher if you want to learn the subject, but you need to study long and hard if you want to do well.",neutral
272,"Man, Dr. Parker is HARD!!! I am a 4.0 student, and I found his tests extremely difficult.  You can study for hours and get a C, if you are lucky.  He is funny, easy to get help from, and good at explaining concepts, but the tests are impossible. I liked Parker, but would only recommend his class to science majors.",neutral
273,"He is a very hard teacher!!! He really knows his stuff and you can tell when he lectures, but it's hard to learn from his lectures. I would listen and take notes and his tests still killed me. The tests are very hard and if you don't know your stuff inside and out you won't do very well. He doesn't give a text book and doesn't have homework.",neutral
274,"Good teacher! Hard class if you're not a math person. Tests are tough, do the homework!",neutral
275,"Weber was my favorite teacher this semester! I think he had a rough go of it transitioning into the Business classes but I think for his first semester he did a good job. He's a nice guy. Can be intimidating, but I recommend just getting to know him! My discussion TA (Julia)  is what made this class rough, not Weber.",neutral
276,Professor Weber hasn't been my teacher for several years but I still go to him whenever I need help on math problems. I like the way Weber teaches. He makes you work for it but he's there for you the whole way. I'll keep getting help from Weber as long as I can. He makes math much more enjoyable for me!,neutral

285,"Professor Weber can be hard to approach, but once you get to know him he's a good guy. Students are hard on him but it's usually on them for not taking time to go visit him during office hours. He's an effective teacher and a nice guy. If you think otherwise than you're probably part of the problem.",neutral
286,I enjoyed Weber as a teacher. He rekindled my love of math.,neutral
287,"If you walk into class with a bad attitude, it's going to be hard for you. He is one of the best math teachers I've had. If you ask questions during class he goes through step by step. His tests are tough but if you put effort into the homework, you will be okay.",neutral
288,Best math teacher I've ever had. ,neutral
289,"Mr. Weber is a fine teacher. He has high expectations and getting to know him can be challenging in such a big class. If you are struggling and want to succeed I recommend visiting him in office hours. One on one he is kind, supportive, and one of the best math teachers I've ever had. ",neutral
290,Many of these comments are unfair. Professor Weber is incredibly knowledgable and supportive. It is important for students to make an effort. Weber respects students who work hard and put time into his class. I recommend going to office hours and paying attention in class. Classes are large so it's important to make yourself known... in a good way!,neutral
291,"Mr. Weber is incredibly helpful. Students need to put forth the effort, visit him in office hours, pay attention in class. If you are respectful and work hard than this class will be great. ",neutral
292,"I don't think the other reviews are fair at all. He isn't rude only to those who disrespect him in class like talk or have their phone out in plain site.  I do recommend going to every class. You'll be good if you're there, follow along and take notes in class. He is VERY helpful if you go see him during office hours!",neutral
293,Difficult but here are my suggestions: Attend ALL lectures&fill out his course packet. Be polite to him. Ask for help after class and in office hours. Write down all your work for online HW even if you aren't doing the notebook. Do the ENTIRE study guide and practice test to study for exams. If can do those comfortably you're set.,neutral
294,Once you understand the Professor's sarcasm it becomes a lot easier to talk to him and receive help.,neutral
295,My guy Kenneth is a god man. The guy really gives out open book pop quizzes that show you what's on the final/midterm and are free extra credit points for the final/midterm. If you do well on the first paper don't worry about the second one. A lot of people give up after the third week. Just show up to class and try on the final/midterm. Ull BeFine,neutral
296,"This is a difficult class, but do the work and you will pass. This class is based on a curve so if you beat the curve then you will be fine. He is a great professor and is willing to help if you ask for it. Many people stop coming to class or don't pay attention at all. Take the class do the work and pass!",neutral
297,Very tough class for 100-level econ but if you're interested in economics it's well worth it. Several people including myself still receive A's because a majority of the class doesn't try. The curve is the only way to get an A. That being said I like his personality. He has a realistic view of  the world which is a cliche for econ professors.,neutral
298,"EASIEST CLASS EVER! This class is not hard, just atten the lecture. Homeworks are easy. you do not really need to read. I did not read throughout his course any book he assigned, just skimmed them when term papers were due and I received the third highest A. My advice, GO TO CLASS and you will pass!",neutral
299,the class is hard... i dont recommend taking it online cuz theres so much to keep track of. he does curve but if you dont do the homework and the 2 term papers your grade will drop easily... i wish he gave feedback on midterms because its confusing to know what you got wrong/right.,neutral
300,"I thought that this class was great. He gives a good economic perspective and is very clear with his class lectures. Be warned, there is a lot of reading. If you don't like to read or are looking for an easy, no effort class, take someone else. But with a little effort, an A is very achievable.",neutral
301,"Recipe for success from a NON-ECON MAJOR - in other words, someone who wants to pass - take the hybrid class, don't go to lectures except for quiz dates, do all of the online work, do the fairly simple term paper and exams - bam, you've passed. some questions he uses on tests are hard but c'mon he's not that bad. I love his off topic rants lmao.",neutral
302,I learned a lot from Dr. Ng. The lectures were interesting with many examples that relate to true life. The extra books were fun to read. I never knew much about life in China or Russia before taking the class.,neutral
303,He is a good professor. take his class if you want an A. ,neutral
304,"Great class. You have to read 4 books plus the textbook but the extra books, the term paper, and the lectures really go all together and teach you something about the world. I believe the students who don't like this class are the ones who never got what Ng is trying to teach because they didn't really read all the books or do all the assignments.",neutral
305,"Okay, he isn't the best teacher but there should be no reason to fail this class. The curve is huge & he gives many extra credit quizzes that are open book & you can work with others. The quizzes are the same concept of what is going to be on the exams. Yes, this class is pretty difficult for its level but it's college.. just study and ask for help",neutral
306,"When I read comments about this professor I was very nervous but had to take his class.  Well, I really liked the way he taught this subject.  It worked great for me to understand.  You have to be patient and pay attention to understand his points.  Those who are looking for an easy grade then do not take this professor.  Loved his teaching style.",neutral
307,I found that most people who complain about this professor simply didn't do their homework. Nor did they ask for help during his office hours. If you just do the homework (and its pretty simple stuff) the exams will be a breeze. Either way he grades on a pretty generous curve. If you just read your book it's almost impossible to get below a C.,neutral
308,Most people come to this site because they are only interested in getting the easiest professor.  They don't care about what they're or they are too stupid to understand anything.  Prof. Ng is a good professor but you have to study.,neutral
309,"If you can't manage to get through one of his classes with at least a B, you should really consider changing major.  His expectations are as clear as anyone's.  He provides you all of the means to succeed.  His lectures are informative, entertaining and brief.  He doesn't subscribe to PC nonsense.  He says what the evidence concludes.  Excellent!",neutral
310,"omg this professor is freaking easy, yes his tests are sorta tricky but you just need to know how to BS your way thru the exams. I got a D on the 1st test, A on thn 2nd and A on the final. You dont even need to show up to class. Just review his ppt and you're good. and do good on the quizes",neutral
311,"I'm not a business major but i really enjoyed this class. It was frustrating doing the assignments before the lectures, but overall I learned a lot from this class. Show up, do all the homework, take the quizes, and yes, you will need to actually study for this class, but you'll do well and it will be well worth it.",neutral
312,Very helpful teacher. Illustrative lectures. Friendly. Scores based on curves.,neutral
313,He's not interactive in his lectures; they are more like presentations. He often spends too much time on his irrelevant examples. Stay the whole class and U will be rewarded with pop quizzes that R added to the tests. U can keep the quiz & get the answers online. Most questions on the quizzes are on the tests.  The curve is GREAT. Do the homework!,neutral
314,"This guy is brilliant. out of 150 students, 50% failed. 50% never showed up to lectures. This also explains the ratings here. His lectures are entertaining. His exams are a bit long, but the curve is amazing. 40% a C&#63; out of 100 questions! people that failed deserved to fail",neutral
315,"Attend class everyday and listend to lecture. The lectures are not that bad and it is usually funny stuff. Exams are hard no joke; however, there is a curve but still don't forget to do the aplia assignment and do your best..Overall, he is a good professor but still hard.",neutral
316,"His curve is so steep, usually a fail on an exam curves to an &quot;A.&quot; There is extra credit almost every week. Great lectures, very helpfull in his office hours. If you take him and GO TO CLASS you should have no problem getting an A. I have learned more from him than any other teacher at the school.",neutral
317,"The only reason this guy gets low ratings is because people are STUPID. His lectures are great, very interesting and usually comical. he gives extra credit almost every week, and the curve... My dog could score above his curve. He curves the class using people who never took it, giving them all zeroes. Listen to the lectures, he is so fair and easy",neutral

325,His class is very interesting. He knows the subject well. But the exam is difficult and the on-line quizz is a waste-of-time.,neutral
326,The only reason people complain about him is that they are lazy and want to have everything handed on a silver platter.  Just study and put effort into the class and you'll get an A. he's a great professor and makes class interesting. He's also willing to answer questions and help students.,neutral
327,"Anyone who gives bad feedback obviously didnt try, cause this class is pretty easy- I hardly went to class and just read the book and I got a B. Just TRY and I promise you'll get a good grade and the curve helps too.",neutral
328,Listen folks he grades on a curve. The competition is not that hard if you simply put effort into his once a week homework. He talks about stuff off the subject but its hilarious. Econ itself is really common sense but if it isn't he may seem a little ambigous.YouDoHaveToGiveAlittleEffortToGetanA,neutral

I have had him for 2 classes already and will take him again.,neutral

He is clear about what is on the test but the student needs to make sure that they understand the concepts in stats to do well because he challenges his students to evaluate and use critical thinking. You need him! lol",neutral
384,I am really upset by all this negativity on Dr. Abara's page. The people hating on him probably didn't even study or come to class.

We have a research paper but since it was the summer, he gave us all the data and the methods. We just really needed to find references. 10% is also showing up, but you get to dissect brains which is fun.",neutral

It is a 400 level cl,neutral

404,He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,worry
405,He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.,worry
406,Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR,worry
407,one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces.

416,Steven rand just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.,worry

Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!",worry

If you have him, get out now!!!!!!",worry

As a senior I was just looking at what people are saying about the worst professor ever here at UND.

The reason why I always needed to ask for help is because he would never really show how to do the problems. He went way too fast, even though he says he'll slow it down until people understand. Very frustrating!!",worry

I read the reviews here before taking this class and had a 'can do it' attitude but in retrospect I am asking, 'Why did I do that to myself?'  The class average was around 40% on tests!  Stressful...",worry

505,"HORRIBLE teacher! I took this class via TV, so I was able to watch and rewatch the lectures. I took notes, attended every lecture, etc. The tests had very few things from class on them. I felt that attending class was pointless, because he went over things that weren't even kind of on the test. I felt like he was just trying to weed people out.",worry
506,"NEVER EVER TAKE ANATOMY WITH Shively!! He plays guitar, but it doesn't apply to anatomy! In my opinion, he makes fun of the students and probably just wants money and business. The tests and the requirements that he pushed students to take are ridiculous!",worry

Anyways, his tests are unclear with sometimes more than one answer possible but you have to pick Shively's choice. I got an A in the class (precurve) but regret taking the course with Shively - take it somewhere else",worry
508,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM SHIVELY. His quizzes/midterm/final are ridiculous. He seems to get some kind of entertainment by seeing students squirm and struggle. Says certain things will be or won't be tested on and it was always he opposite. You have a better chance of doing well if you take Homan, or take it at BYU and live to tell the story!",worry
509,Shively is a brilliant man... unfortunately he likes to wave that brilliance in students faces with the types of questions he asks on tests. Honestly the worst test giver i have ever heard of. if you take this class be ready to work your butt off and not score well. lab is great lecture is ridiculous.,worry

For Lecture, go through outline, read chapter, and quiz yourself. Shively will help you out, he will hold study sessions for questions. Write them down, think, and ask him.",worry

516,I worked very hard in this class. It required a lot of work for being an Intro class but felt like a higher level class. His tests were very tricky. I didn't like how he would ramble on and you didn't know what to study. Find a different professor!,worry
517,"This class is the hardest thing I have ever done. You will study the text till you can no longer read. But I don't regret it. If you put in the time to study for each quiz, you will learn the material. The tests are tricky because of the wording, so watch yourself and learn his tricks. Don't take this class somewhere else if you want to be medical.",worry

The downloads for the course rarely worked, so I would highly recommend just renting the dvd's.  The dvd's were informative and Dr. Shively is definitely an intelligent man, however it was impossible to contact him.  The course was horrible.",worry
520,this class demands so much of your time! I did learn a ton about anatomy but the tests don't really have anything to do with that! I got above the class average every time but was still in the 40-60% range on all of them. If you attend class and study you will learn a ton but the tests and quizes are very overly difficult.,worry
521,"This class becomes your LIFE!! Plan on studying 24/7. I don't agree with his tests at all. I think he should test you more on what you study, not how well you can get into his mind. He is very tricky with his tests. Something is wrong when you fail a test and your happy cause you know its at least average. Something is wrong with that!",worry
522,"If the same passion of the Prof was shared with his students, there would be better grades thus better ratings. A little overkill for an intro. I'm just bitter because I dont have 15-20hrs a week to study because of famil/work/school. I learned more practical stuff about Anatomy and Physiology in my Emt Basic and Intermediate classes.",worry
523,"If I were you, I would take a critical thinking class before taking this class.  Half of the time I wasn't sure what he was asking for.  When the class average is 40%(ish) or lower, then it is the there is something the teacher is not doing right. This class is insane.  Plan on studying for at least 20 hours a week for this class alone. Good luck!",worry
524,No one should ever complain about his anatomy class. Sure its hard but he gives you the tools to succeed its just a matter if you use them. If you plan on being in the medical field this class is a great eye opener to see what it is like. I highly reccommend his class. He is an amazing teacher and you will learn a ton.,worry
525,"It's funny reading all the ratings. He's very hard, there's no way around that. But it all depends on your work ethic and attitude. If you are committed to working hard and have a good attitude about him and anatomy, you'll do fine. It's graded on a curve which helps a lot.",worry

528,Do not take this class unless you plan to become a doctor!  He pushes you way harder than it is worth for a lower level class.  In fact I think the professors think it is an upper level class.  You can take anatomy online from another college and trust me it is much easier! Also you have to put in way to much time for a 4 credit class!!!,worry

The class requires a LOT of effort though, but if you work hard it will pay off, there is a big curve at the end so the goal is to just stay above the average (which tends to be around 40-60%). Would not recommend taking this class with other classes that would require a lot of time...",worry

You would think after giving a 30 point curve on the 2nd test he would get a clue, but he didn't.  he makes it unbelievebly difficult and demanding on your time.  He is a great teacher and makes lecture really fun.  If your going to take him be prepared to eat, sleep, breathe anatomy.",worry

I ended this class with a C- which is the lowest grade I've ever received.,worry

You will have to read & teach yourself. His tests are difficult and have strange wording. He is also very disrespectful when he tries to answer a students question.",worry
550,"My major is biology because I love it! But after the first day of class I realized what I was in for... lots of late nights of stuDYING and tear covered papers. I've failed almost every test and I've studied like crazy. He likes to play the 'guess what I'm thinking' game, but he thinks really oddly. He requires so much outside of class.",worry
551,Hardly learned anything from the teacher. The most you will learn is from the kid sitting next to you and the internet. When asked questions he either gets frustrated or repeats himself exactly how he worded it the first time. Tests are really hard and there is a lot of homework. I'm a good student and I felt I was drowning.,worry
552,I'd rather be replace my visine with onion juice than sit through another lecture with Mr. Whaley. If being pubicly insulted is your thing Simply ask a question during class!

Tests come directly from lecture slideshows and the practice exams he offers on Canvas. Exams are very straight forward.  Mandatory recitations are worthless, but lectures are bearable.  ",worry

He does interrupt the presenters fairly often to give his 2� even though it's not his presentation.",worry

He uses fancy vocab in his lectures with out defining his jargon words. He doesn't communicate at all with you through emails and such, not even if you use canvas. his links to learn more about concepts never work- EVER.",worry
615,Be prepared to spend half a semester stroking the ego of Charles Darwin only to have no questions about him on the final. This class was horribly structured and after studying all online materials I could find for a bio 1010 final I walked out of the test blindsided by the 3000 level questions. Not to mention he never responds to emails.,worry
616,"If you're unlucky enough to get this course, GET THE OPTIONAL TEXTBOOK. The teaching model is poor, with ridiculously long reading assignments, and 3 question quizzes over the material (quizzes are 25% of final grade). The textbook helps to condense & explain the material. Some quiz material is not covered in the online videos. The textbook helps.",worry
617,"His tests are really difficult. I would study hard for them, visit him to ask additional questions, and would still get C's on his tests. This was the same story from my other classmates. He is a decent guy and you will learn A LOT. But you may struggle keeping your head above water during the semester  Consider taking Professor Bayer- Choose life!",worry
618,"There is no book, just random websites he assigns you to read from. Instead of basing the tests on the information from the websites, the tests are based off of Biology textbooks that we don't use. Because of that, the tests are VERY hard to study for.  Also, the final was really hard (no study guide). The class average was 51/110.",worry
619,"I have nothing good to say about Professor Parker. As others have said, he didn't have anything to do with the course. To expound on that, none of his exams matched the course material he used (but did not create), and the final exam was mostly chemistry questions, which matched neither his stolen course material or his mid-terms exams.",worry
620,"Absolutely ridiculous class. Uses material and lectures from a different professor, tests are arbitrary and impossible to study for, the final was super heavy on one section of material, and, again, impossible to study for. Yes, I passed. Yes, I got a decent grade. But this class was way too much of a headache. Do not take from this professor!",worry
621,The material is copy pasted from a three year old course that he didn't even create and then tests us on material NOT from the online lectures (think BIOL 3000+ material). Written assignments are graded by a TA so he doesn't even do his own grading for ANY of the work. Why should I bother to put in effort into class when  my teacher doesn't?,worry
622,He isn't even teaching a class he put together. Its a 3 year old course from another Prof. He doesn't seem to understand the online system. Incredible amounts of reading assigned in a very short period of time. Tests cover the most minute details. This is not biology 1010. This is a 3000 level class. Do not take unless you literally have no choice.,worry
623,"I don't know where he gets the materials for everything, but quizzes, tests, and exams all seemed to have different information. I would get 100% on the quizzes and tests, and then get into the exam and walk out with a 50% feeling like it was all new information. He basically just reads off the slide shows he has prepared. It was a confusing class.",worry
624,"Seems like he wants you to learn bio, but does not want you to do well in the class. Lessons are general but tests are specific and cover things not discussed in class, they are loaded with trick questions. If you are a bio major looking for a challenge then he is great, but if you are just looking to get your 3cr GE bio credit then there is easier",worry
625,"The workload in this class is ridiculous. You could easily spend 2 to 4 hours per day just trying to keep up with this class. The quizzes are very difficult, the exams are even worse. If you retake the quizzes the second set of questions is always harder than the first. I would not recommend anyone taking this class from him. I should have looked.",worry
626,The quizzes and tests are NOT based on lectures or reading... The only helpful information I found for this class was Quizlet... study for the exams using Quizlet and you will score will... if you actually do the work expect to be befuddled on the exams...,worry
627,"I took this course online after earning a C+ years ago on the main campus. I ended up with a letter grade lower the second time around. The course online is doable if you will set aside time to study. It's easy to do the assignments but the tests are more difficult. If you aren't a good test taker this class isn't for you,the final exam is tough!",worry
628,This was my chance to retake biology (I passed several years ago with a C) I thought this would be an easy shot since I am in my third year and know my stuff. Not so!! The material was way harder than necessary and I didn't learn a thing. Doesn't let you go back to check answers on quiz and everything is on websites and 2 hr long videos on Darwin.,worry
629,Not book based teaching.  All things expected to learn are from websites.  ,worry
630,His tests are awful!  He writes his own tests but he shouldn't. so bad! trick questions galore! ,worry
631,DO NOT TAKE. Parker is a hard teacher. He doesn't work well with the students. Tests are tough. ,worry
632,AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!!  He treats you like you are a lesser being and expects you to pass a timed 30 minute quiz that he is weeks away from covering the material and the quiz content is hardly on his slides and the chapter readings are about 100 pages each with fine print.  So good luck trying to find the answers on your own. ,worry
633,"Professor Parker makes a lot of comparisons with everyday things, which can get a little confusing. I basically teach myself Biology and we have quizzes all the time about material we haven't even covered yet.  It's not a hard class, but it can be quite stressful and inconvenient.",worry
634,"He's a good teacher and explains things well. He tries to be funny (usually isn't), but at least tries to make the class relatively interesting. However, I wouldn't recommend taking the class because he tests you on material he hasn't taught yet. His lessons are about 2 weeks behind the tests and quizzes so you're required to teach yourself. ",worry
635,"I'm not going to lie, this is a hard class. You have to know A LOT! But Professor Parker is a good teacher. He's really funny and is extremely nice and helpful when you have a question. You won't need a textbook other than for the LearnSmart assignments he makes you do. All of his tests are based off of his PowerPoints and old exams, so take notes!",worry
636,Professor Parker is terrible. I was seriously confused the whole semester and when you ask questions he makes you feel really stupid. I would not recommend Professor Parker to ANYONE.  Tests are really hard and when you ask what chapters in the text book that are being covered he says all of them. ,worry
637,I didn't realize until now that I ended up getting a B+ in the class & I have NO idea how that happened because I only passed one test the entire semester. He walks and sweats and rambles the entire class. He reminds me of Kevin from the office: boring. He just lectures and only has exams so you need to study EVERYTHING in class. Do not reccommend.,worry
638,"This class was not easy. If you follow the course objectives and use the old practice exams (extensively), you'll pull off a good grade. It was a lot to take in, especially for someone who isn't majoring in science whatsoever.",worry
639,"Worst teacher ever! I have now taken this class twice and have passed both times, but not with a very good grade. Your grade is weighted by exams and quizzes, which are nearly impossible to understand. A friend of mine taking biology at BYU looked at one of my quizzes and said that it was harder than the test she had recently taken that day.",worry
640,"By far the worst teacher I have ever came across. Went to him several times and ask for help because I was struggling and he simply told me to 'Do better.' Test you on things you haven't covered yet, ramble on about nothing, no homework to help your grade, and no matter how hard you study the material, it's always different on the test. Horrible.",worry
641,"Doesn't respond to e-mails, rambles about nothing useful during class, doesn't follow chapter outline of textbook, grade is based solely on exams and a few quizzes - no homework to cushion grade or help with understanding of concepts. Nothing but a cause of stress. This class is the reason I no longer have a scholarship. I even had a tutor.",worry
642,horrible class. no class interaction just lectures the entire time. he goes on tangents all of the time but still expects you to know everything. his study guides aren't at all like his tests and he has a lot of work for you to do. He treats you all like you know everything already. it's nearly impossible to pass his class.,worry
643,"DON'T TAKE IT. Tests are tricky. There's no hw to cushion your grade. He takes your top 10 best quiz grades to replace a test grade, but even that doesn't help.  I had another Biology professor tutor me and she said the material he taught should be in advanced bio classes and he didn't make sense of his questions. Avoid him.",worry
644,"He is very vague, and then his tests are super hard. I have taken biology twice, including a college prep biology class in high school and still have no idea what is going on during the tests. Questions are worded weird and when he is asked questions about stuff in class he tells stupid stories instead of answering it coherently. AVOID THIS CLASS!",worry
645,"Horrible teacher, do not take him if at all possible. Choose another professor other than Parker. He makes his class and quizes easy and then when you think that you are catching on and you know your stuff, his tests come along and wipe you out and ruin any chance of a good grade. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!",worry
646,"If at all possible wait until there's a better teacher you can take Cell Bio from. Doesn't test you on huge sections that he covers then asks for overly specific things on stuff he talked almost nothing about in class. Don't take from him, have have been warned.",worry
647,Wait so what you talked about for 20 minutes wont be on the test but the 5 second mention of an additional protein will be a third of the test questions&#63;,worry
648,This professor is awful. DO NOT TAKE HIM! Unclear on everthing. tests you on material never discussed in the class. REAL BAD TEACHER,worry
649,He is a pretty cool teacher. He says that everything on the test or quizzes will be talked about in class which is untrue. He has a quiz every weekend that covers materials which are worded strngly and covers materials he has not talked about. He is a cool funny guy but his test is a little hard.,worry
650,"I would recommend not getting the book, his tests are on the things he talks about in class.  He dumbs down his lectures so you feel like you have a grip on the material but he doesn't dumb down the tests.  He goes into way more detail than necessary. With teachers like him it's no surprise that Biol 1010 is the most failed course at UVU.",worry
651,"A teacher so bad he was hung in effigee by students. Test material is not found in book or covered in class. It's easy to feel like you know what's going on in lectures but when it comes time for a test, quiz or anything else you are going to be graded on it's another story. Asking questions is futile. He dodges them. Take Bio from Bybee or Harris.",worry
652,At any cost do not take this teacher. you will learn nothing but yet somehow its really hard to get a good grade.,worry

655,"Frustration is the theme of this class. Lectures are barely useful. The test questions were in fact written by Hitler. Condescending looks and answers to your questions are typical. I managed an A, no thanks to him, I just neglected friends and family for 3 months to study. Boycott this &quot;teacher&quot; he contributes to Americas poor education. HORRIBLE.",worry
656,"Horrible teacher. Lectures were often irrelevant to tests and quizzes. Your text is your only hope for a good grade. Tests are very specific lectures are very, very vague. I went to talk to him on two occasions over a concept I was struggling with and was met with rudeness and disrespect.",worry
657,"This was the worst teacher ever! I went to class everyday, wrote notes word for word then re-wrote my notes, read the chapters, then studied the study objectives and still only got a C+. He sucks. Words can't even describe how terrible he is. Do not take this class.",worry
658,just get out of the class while you still can. i'm a straight a student and i barely passed the class. i studied at least eight hours a week and still did terrible in the class. just dont waste your time or money for this class. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GUY!!!!!!!,worry
659,"Definitely not an intro to biology class. Tests are WAY hard and that is the basis of your whole grade. There is one research paper, which he grades harshly. He never returns emails. Could quite possibly the worst professor at UVU. He definitely ruined any interest I had in any science field.",worry
660,Parker is the most worthless teacher I have ever had. I have emailed him several times and never get anything back. He had surgery this semester and we had a sub for over a month who was WAY better then him. He takes forever to explain one concept and has analogies he uses that make him sound like a retard and they make it was harder to understand.,worry

He is so unclear about everything he teaches, and when you do understand a subject, it isnt on the test. The tests are so hard, and i think my class averaged a 62% on one test.

666,"Dr. Parker is very nice,very intelligent. However, he teaches as if he was at an Ivy League University and as if we were all biology majors at an Ivy League University. What is discussed in class has almost no relevance to what is on the tests. Unless you are a science nerd avoid his class. He needs to work on his teaching skills.",worry

His tests are extremely difficult! Only nice thing is you have no homework. You do have to write a 3-5 page essay one time in the semester. He's definitely a terrible teacher!",worry
673,DONT TAKE THIS CLASS PERIOD! WORST TEACHER AT UVU!!!,worry
674,"This is one hard class and Parker is not the easier professor to take it from. His tests come out of his lectures so I thought taking notes would be enough, but his tests are REALLY hard. I'm a straight-A student and will be hoping to pull a C out of this class.",worry

He makes it a lot more complicated than it should be.",worry

If you work to be friendly and participate, Mr. Weber will become your best friend. I passed this class with flying colors and found it quite easy.",worry

728,"He was a good professor. Kind of monotone, but interestong nonetheless. He has a very VERY generous grading curve, it helps A LOT! He is pretty easy going and give chances to recieve extra credits on future tests through pop quizes.",worry
729,One of the worst professors I've ever had in my academic life! He rambles about himself and stuff that have nothing to do with MicroEconomics and sometimes he even comes in with powerpoints made about non-related stuff the course! For example motorcycles! and what bikes he used to ride when he was a kid.. don't even bother taking the class with him,worry
730,DONT DO IT IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY. His main goal is to ramble about himself then trick you. He turns the simplest concepts into mind games and the answer is always 'it depends'. I learned more about the mans childhood than Econ. Don't do it.,worry
731,Confusing as can be. Not Helpful at all. Tests are impossible,worry
732,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF, The worst professor I have taken ever. He goes off on tangents and requires a term paper, His tests are difficult and tries to trick you. He seriously should be fired. I never write reviews but I really do not like this professor, IDK what any other student may say dont take him.",worry
733,"Let me just warn you: Even with his crazy curves this class is crazy hard!!! I am regretting every single moment of it.Take it next semester with a better professor if he is your last resort! Makes subject difficult and I don't understand on top of that why he finds it amusing to trick us. If class average is below 50, something is obviously wrong!",worry
734,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! His lectures are hard to follow and he goes off topic on these ridiculous examples. He does not apply the students for the assignments given and the live class is a waste of time. The work load is high and the grades don't reflect ones true knowledge of the material.,worry
735,"For the Love of your life do not take this professor, took him my first semester for 160 (micro-econ) and I passed with an A thanks to his term papers, but I decided to take him again for 160 (I had no choice thanks to my work schedule) and for 160 he HAD NO TERM PAPERS, unfortunately I failed! The way he explains ECON is incomprehensible!",worry

737,"If not for the curve, this semesters passing students would be less than 20,in a 200 student class.The curve ensures anyone who does at least one page of hw can pass, but if you plan to take the next courses (161, 300, etc) you will fail since you wont know the material that you were suppose to learn in 160",worry
738,"The only reason I passed was b/c i had taken econ 161 before transferring.He goes off topic constantly that i ended up sleeping in class.He wont tell you what you missed and has that smirk of looking down on you for not knowing.I suggest that if you have not taken econ before and his is the last available class, wait another semester.Not worth it",worry
739,This dude cannot teach. He just talks the entire class and sometimes goes off on stories that have nothing to do with the topic. Take someone else if possible.,worry

Lectures that ramble off topic, few references to the book and even with perfect attendance very little learned.

744,"Can anyone tell me how someone can be called a teacher when the average test scores are in the 50s and upper 40s&#63;  He does not know how to teach which is why he uses a curve.  As other's have said he often rambles on about poker, gambling and other personal interests.                    He was kindof creepy too.  HE IS NOT A TEACHER. AVOID THIS GUY",worry

768,Class was fairly easy. attendance was not required but gives you about 2 extra credit quizzes randomly for each midterm and the final. so be at class and take those quizzes and it could raise your test grade by a letter. just read the chapters and study his slides and you'll do fine. he also curves. 72 percent earned an A on one midterm,worry

I enjoyed going to class for the sole purpose of observing his personality, but most of the time I spent wondering what I was paying for.

831,"If you do not have a job, and all you do is school, this class may be slightly easier for you. But it would be a lie to say he is a good teacher, or grades fairly. The study guides, and going to class contained maybe 10% of what is actually on the tests. The average test scores are around 35%.",sadness
832,"Shively is a good lecturer in that what he says is engaging and interesting to learn.  His tests though are horrendous. He does exactly what they say not to do when giving a test, and makes it so that everyone fails.  This is just the intro. class, yet it felt like the real thing minus the lab.  Do not take this class!",sadness
833,This was the hardest and the most rewarding class you will ever take.  You can practically applied the material taught in class into reality.  Be motivated and dedicated to this class and an A is possible.  If you work for it you can get it.  Must love to read to understand to survive this class.,sadness
834,I took his online course and it was awful.  He offered us ZERO assistance and did not respond to one single email all semester.  I think it's unfair we can't review our exams to see what we missed and why.  He is harsh in his grading and likes to trick you on the quizzes and exams.  The high in our class was a 62% so he graded on a curve.,sadness
835,I was a straight A student. I studied every day. Once a week I stayed up ALL night studying. I got a B-. There was just too much material to cover and the lecture quizes are tricky even if &quot;Mr.&quot; shively disagrees. I'm embarrassed that I worked so hard and did so poorly. Thank you Mr. Shively,sadness
836,LITERALLY JUST STAY AWAY. TAKE IT FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL. I have always been a straight A student. I recieved a C+ in this class. I spent an average of 20+ hours in the lab a week and ten hours studying the lecture book. RUN AWAY NOW. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME..,sadness
837,I don't even know where to begin. The quizzes and tests are so ridiculous. Studying does no good whatsoever. Usually the class average on a quiz is around 35-50%. Shively is definately better than the other teachers. This class is literally a joke.,sadness
838,"Just about everything in lecture is right out of the textbook. Tests are extremely hard and tricky. He's not interested in teaching, just interested in complete memorization of his 1000 page text. Doesn't want right answers, want his answers. I would take this class at another university.",sadness
839,He's boring and his tests are tricky and dumb.,sadness
840,Anatomy has always been my favorite subject till I took this class. I took it as an elective. Shively's tests and quizzes do not coordinate with material covered in class or what is in the book. He seems to like to watch us all struggle and fail. This class was a complete waste of time-if it isn't absolutely required for your major- don't take it.,sadness
841,"Doesn't prepare you for tests.  Hard test writer, often crude and offensive.",sadness
842,He thrives off of failing students and the on the midterm the high was a 62%!  All the quizzes and tests contain material not gone over in class or in the text.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM HIM!,sadness
843,This course is super hard for an intro class. The majority of the class was failing all quizzes and tests. He would teach us the simple things and then test us on the more complex things that weren't ever explained in class. Good luck!,sadness
844,Words tests so they are next to impossible to understand. And students do not receive results of tests a quizzes till sometimes a month after it was taken. Very hard to study for the next test/quiz when you don't know how you did on the first one.,sadness

849,If you're confused during a lecture don't ask him just google it or something. Because he'll just confuse you even more. There's quite a heavy work and little room for messing up (just like most classes). Exams are borderline brutal and he offers very little extra credit to fix that. You're supposed to read all 24 assigned chapters. 30 Pages each.,sadness
850,Does not like to help students and is rude when questions are asked in class. He never understood where students were coming from and confused the class every time he tried to clarify something. He really just wanted to teach Ornithology to the class when we were in 1610.,sadness
851,"Wayne is a nice guy, but a horrible teacher. When you ask questions in class he hardly ever understands and will go off and answer a totally different question that has nothing to do with what you asked.

852,"Its possible to get an A, you will for sure learn the material, but most of that will be accredited to the homework you do. If you ask a question in class, he won't understand it, he'll go on a big rant about something unrelated to the question, and a person who sits by you will end up answering your question. ",sadness
853,"Great guy, but poor teaching skills. I would not recommend taking a class from him unless you already have a good understanding of biology and enjoy teaching yourself the material. He gives tons of pre-lecture quizzes and the tests were rough. I didn't learn much from his class.",sadness
854,Terrible. Doesn't provide any help outside of class. Requires you to already know the information and do the homework before he teaches it to you. Completely useless as a professor.,sadness
855,"Do not take Biology 1610 from Whaley. He is so confusing and doesn't teach anything that is on his tests. Not only that, but he expects you to know things that aren't even in the book. He goes off on random tangents about birds all the time. He doesn't ever understand any ones questions so you don't get a clear understanding.",sadness
856,He's one of those teachers who thinks all you do is attend their class and study biology.  Half of the tests he gives are open on saturday and if you take them on monday you pay a fee. If you dont understand the concepts prior to class you may leave confused as he mixes up words and concepts.  He's a less than average professor.,sadness
857,"Very scatter brained, and hates awnsering questins i class. He loves laughing at himself teaching because he doesnt comprehend that his students dont understand what he teaches. DO the MASTERING BIOLOGY and you may pass.",sadness
858,Showing up to class will prove uneventful given that it is entirely possible to get an A in the class from simply showing up on the first day and once again on the last day for the final exam. It is likely that many students will gain nothing from showing up to class on a daily basis.,sadness
859,"he is a great guy but does not know how to teach these classes at a lower level. upper level classes are great. he does not like to answer questions, tests are way hard. take another teacher if possible, if not you will live in your book if you want to pass.",sadness
860,Real smart man. But terrible at sharing what he knows. Very confusing. If you take his class plan on learning the stuff on your own because his lectures are not helpful at all. I had the hardest times staying awake in class :( A zoologist teaching biology didn't seem to mix well,sadness
861,"Definitely a bird man. Little scattered sometimes on his lectures. Read the book, attend class and go through his power points and you will do fine",sadness
862,"Mr. Whaley is decent.  His tests and quizzes are quite easy even without reading regularly as long as you show up to class.  However, if you're actually trying to learn the subject it can be very difficult.  He's is very poor with answering questions and he often goes on long tangents.  Easy for science credit, poor for learning.",sadness
863,His lectures are ridiculously hard to understand and he never actually teaches the material covered on the 6 midterm tests that are given during the semester.  You are forced to learn solely from the textbook. I would avoid his class like the plague but I hear the other BIOL 1610 teachers aren't any better...,sadness
864,"Great as a person outside of class, BUT A HORRIBLE TEACHER!! When asked a question, he wouldn't answer, or would expect you to know. Wasn't able to answer his own test questions, test questions were incorrect and from a different book. He is not the teacher for learning Bio.",sadness
865,"Whaley is a character.  The first three sections I went every day and studied his power points, I got a 67, 72, and a 71. I started going once a week, and studying the book only.  I started getting 90's on his exams.  He was rude to me whenever I went to his office to talk to him.  Stay with the book, you'll be fine.",sadness
866,Hard class you have to study like crazy!! Prof. wasn't too bad though.,sadness
867,"he speaks another language! He is unorganized, and doesn't answer questions well.",sadness
868,He might know the material he is teaching but he is terrible at getting that information to me the student. He tells you to remember things that aren't on the tests. If you enjoy teaching yourself biology and wasting time in his class and then teaching yourself through the book you'll LOVE this class. Worst class i have ever taken.,sadness
869,"He's not the best at explaining stuff so you'll end up reading the book half a dozen times. His tests are l ike passing a kidney stone. seriously. If you are good at learning on your own, i'd recommend him. You'll like the way he puts stuff &quot;best hearing you'll ever hear.&quot; &quot;much more lesser&quot;",sadness
870,"very bad teacher...arrogant, childish, selfish, unclear.  he actually made people in my class feel bad/stupid for asking questions - they wouldn't ask questions again after that. i got an A, you can if the text becomes your best friends and you are willing to put up with a dork/jerk for a teacher and &quot;jump through his hoops.&quot;",sadness
871,What a moron!  I don't know where this guy acquired his degree but he can't teach.  Beware Bio at the U or the Y prior to coming here.  This teacher sucks!,sadness
872,"I would not recommend taking this course online. The teacher has a very structured and organized course. As well as a bunch of lectures that took him some time to make, so props to him. However, the tests are very hard to understand. If you take this class... study study study. Go over every thing. Especially the Chem section...",sadness
873,I would not recommend taking this class online. It was very difficult for me to understand the lectures. He requires his students to take the final exam at the UVU testing center so you really need to know what is going on in the class if you want to get a good grade on the exam. For now on I will be taking my science classes in person.,sadness
874,"Dr Parker is fairly nice and wants to help. He will answer questions that you ask in and after class. Grade comes from tests, but the lowest exam is dropped and replaced with top 10 quiz scores which is helpful. His tests are difficult. They are meant to trick you. Super ambiguous questions that leave you guessing even when you know the material.",sadness
875,"Dont expect to pass his class. He is not a good teacher. He is on chptr 10 but, all the hmw to be done is online and they r on chptr 13.he wont mov dates. His test don't make sense. says his test r only on stuff covered in class &they're not. There is nothin on your grade but the exams. no homework no attendance just the tests.",sadness
876,"HOrrible teacher to communicate with. Sent emails, canvas messages and no response ever!! How is a student suppose to communicate with the professor when he is ill. His lectures are hard and and test format is confusing. Only thing good about his class is that he records his lectures.",sadness
877,"Dr. Parker seems as though he wants you to learn but his test questions can be difficult. Don't miss class and when you study for the tests, stress the details covered in class and on the powerpoints. Your grade will seem to be low because of your test scores but if you do well on the quizzes, your grade will be better than expected. Good luck.",sadness
878,"He says everything that we're tested on is in his powerpoints. A lot of the time, things are not in the powerpoints or they're in powerpoints that we haven't even covered yet. So things that haven't been introduced in class (or the powerpoints he's gone over) are on the tests. He gets annoyed if you ask questions in email, or doesn't answer email",sadness
879,"The worst biology teacher I have ever had. He's rude to students questions in class. Tests are extremely hard, and questions are very poorly written. Quizes are hard but if you work in groups you'll be okay. Is a horrible teacher. This class could be really cool, but because you spend the entire semester trying to figure out what he wants its not.",sadness
880,The worse professor at UVU. He should not teach. He doesn't care about students nor your learning. He is lazy and will not answer your questions. Studying will not help and listening to lectures won't do much either. He has tenure but needs to replaced fast. There needs to be another option for cell bio at UVU. Unfortunately will not learn much.,sadness
881,"He is an average lecturer. He is pretty clear most of the time. Although most of what he tests on is taught in class he seems to stress things differently than the book. Some things he stresses are not even in the book. This class was difficult for me for this reason. Also, fill in the blank quizzes are vague and it is difficult to guess his answer",sadness
882,Course lacks structure. Doesn't use the book very much and the lectures are aimless.  I have a 3.8 gpa all science/math courses (no generals) so I feel I know my stuff..don't take this class from parker.  Hardest (and not the good kind of hard where you actually learn) B+ I've ever gotten.,sadness
883,His general biology course is fairly difficult. Makes you memorize specific things that are useless. 25 minute 'recap' of what we learned last time. Only really learning 25 minutes of new content each class,sadness
884,he's a really nice guy and when you go to class it seems like it won't be super hard if you pay attention and take notes. but when you take tests and quizzes you realize that almost nothing that was discussed in class is on the tests. EVERYTHING is from the book. the only way to get a good grade is to memorize the text book.,sadness
885,"Biology is a really hard class in general I think he's a pretty funny guy, he helped me when I needed it. The tests are difficult and the quizzes he gives every week were also difficult, you really have to know the information he teaches and if you don't know ASK and read ahead in the book. I liked him as a teacher but biology is just a hard class.",sadness
886,"My advice: STUDY!!!! his tests are extremely hard. He quizzes you on things he hasn't taught yet so you're gonna have to read the textbook. You're only graded on quizzes, 3 exams, and the final. The good thing about this class is there's no homework. Just study hard. I'm lucky if I even pass this class.",sadness
887,"Unpleasant expereince! Very poor teaching style. Teaches casually, but tests VERY specifically. Don't take this class from this teacher. He has so little trust in students and plans teaching and material around that. Please be aware if you are an &quot;A&quot; type student.",sadness
888,"Hard teacher, not recommend if you are taking this class for general ed. credit.",sadness
889,I do like his personality and way of teaching. His tests are half info from class and half knowing how the entire WOLRD works! I did learn some from his class because I had to work my butt off to even get a 65% on the tests. He does normalize which is how I pulled a C. But I am a straight A student! He is hard to get ahold of out of class.,sadness
890,This class was way rough. I never missed class and still had no idea what he was talking about. He is very hard to get in contact with and when you do contact him is isn't very nice or helpful at all. I wouldn't take this class if you don't know anything about bio because he jumps right into things and moves very fast. The tests are very hard!,sadness
891,Professor Parker is really hard!  All his material comes out of his lectures so missing class is not an option.  I had to miss several classes due to my daughter's health problems and Professor Parker would never return my emails.  I had a really difficult time with this class.,sadness
892,"Mr. Weber is not a bad teacher. He doesn't grade fair, if you have to make up a test he grades it himself and is a lot tougher than the grad students that do it. In lecture he will answer questions but makes the person feel stupid. Lectures are slow because no one will answer. My adviser told me she had heard from a bunch of students he is not good",sadness
893,"His teaching style isn't all that great. If math is not your strongest subject, you probably will struggle.",sadness
894,"Weber is a good guy, it sucks that he's a terrible teacher. This was his first time teaching this class (History of Math) to the best of my knowledge, so maybe I just had a bad experience off that. He's a tough grader, it's really hard to tell what he wants sometimes. ",sadness
895,"He is a very interesting grader. If you like to get perfect grades on your assignments it probably wont happen in this class. You pretty much copy down whatever he writes on the board but don't do any examples. Online homework is very easy, but test are hard as you didn't do examples at the caliber of the questions on the test. Poor class.",sadness
896,"Weber is a good professor if you can live up to his type of teaching style. He's extremely rude though if you are to ask a 'stupid' question. I took this class twice, and still didn't pass with a C. I had peers that were in for their 3rd and 4th attempts. Take this class online through LCCC or EWCC.",sadness
897,"Dr. Weber really does try to help his students, but is very rude if the student asks a question that is 'stupid' in his opinion. He teaches formulas and rarely does more than one example of a concept. I have learned more from Kahn Academy than from him. I would not suggest him to anyone. He grades very difficult.",sadness
898,Most comments put forth about this teacher are pretty accurate. The prereq for this class was as easy A for me. I then get brutally savaged by the first test. My primary complaint is his inability to teach what you need to know for the test. I took my W and will be retaking it with a foreign student as a teacher. Yes Weber is that bad.,sadness
899,terrible teacher. monotone...boring...just writes as you copy... no practice in class... test way harder than any problem on homework or in class. stay clear!,sadness
900,He gives fairly good lectures up until the sections become complicated. Can be very rude to students after poor exam grades and can be downright arrogant when talking with students 1 on 1. Does NOT prepare you for exams and does not give you a good idea of what material will be on the exam. Loves to 'massage' equations a little bit too much...,sadness
901,"He's a terrible teacher, the homework system is awful. He doesn't make anything clear, and the tests are hard compared to the homework (which isn't lenient to mistakes). DON'T take this teacher.",sadness
902,I felt that the homework was simple yet the tests were hard compared to what we were taught in class. I felt he didnt care about the sucess of his students. I did not enjoy this class because of him.,sadness
903,Not helpful at all... Tests are very difficult while class lecture examples are very simple in nature.,sadness
904,"Sorry, but for someone of his stature in the UW math department methinks Mr. Skeletor here takes himself way too seriously.",sadness
905,"Condescending and disrespectful towards students. Not recommended, obviously.",sadness
906,"Class lectures do not have anything to do with textbook reading. He talks about sports cars and tells funny stories but he's off topic. Homework is 800 point quizzes (sometimes 1200 points) and difficult because you must teach yourself the material. Class is curved. 2 exams, several quizzes, 2 book reports. Proceed with caution.",sadness
907,"Very knowledgeable about the subject. Goes off topic, but covers everything. Gives good life examples. Class is not very fun, but if you write the papers (a well written paper) and try on the homework, you can pass. He curves to the class average, so if you try you can pass. Not the best professor, but if you try you can pass with at least a C.",sadness
908,"if you think you could pass this class through hard work, then good luck. the only way to pass this class is through the curve and only the curve.  i got an A tho",sadness
909,"The one good thing I have to say about him is he doesn't hide anything. He has everything on the page for his online class. But his lectures barely helped on the homework and barely did anything for the test. I basically had to teach myself. Would not take him again, given the option, choose another teacher, PLEASE!!",sadness
910,He is confusing and tries to be funny. Received a D in the class. Some of my friends had better experiences. He does post everything online. He records his lectures so attendance isn't mandatory but your grade reflects your effort.,sadness
911,"Went out of my way to tell you to not take this professor. Goes of topic, explains vaguely, expects you to know the material yourself. 2 term papers, 1 midterm and a final along with homework that's difficult. Wouldn't recommend.",sadness
912,"This class is just work, work, work. I am usually good with keeping up with assignments but the way this professor sets everything up is just confusing! I go to every lecture take notes and pay close attention but to me it seems like the exams are just so far off from the lectures! I am so confused in this class and I don't understand anything. ",sadness
913,"This is an extremely hard course. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Probably 60% of the class ended with a non-passing grade.  You have to do many online quizes online, and MOST OF THE TIME IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE LECTURES.... Quizzes would take up to 6 hours for 55 questions with at least 2 people and yet you will score if you're lucky a B grade on them. ",sadness
914,"This teacher is terrible. The lectures are unclear, the work has no direction. The homework is all objective but yet there is still right and wrong answers... There is no help from him. The worst is when there are wrong questions on the tests and homework, that is pointed out by the students EVERY time. Do not take this class!!!",sadness
915,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF!!!  Look elsewhere.  Took the online class, got SO confused.  Monotone, doesn't explain whats on the tests, just references old tests that he posts on moodle but even still the old tests doesn't give you answers, you have to do the work and hopefully you get it right.  Does not respond to questions, just refers you to his FAQ.",sadness
916,"He is the only professor I dislike.He likes rambling on about other things and then  makes a poor attempts to relate it back the subject. He believes CSUN students are incapable of surviving in a more 'prestigious' university, that is why he curves. Test are mainly from powerpoints and book. I got a B but it was not because of his great teaching.",sadness
917,"If you just want to pass Econ 160, I recommend his online class. As long as you attempt the online homework and do the term papers with effort, you should be able to get at least a B with his curve because so many people in online classes don't do/forget assignments. His midterm and final are hard, but even after doing horribly on both, I got a B.",sadness
918,"So, yeah, this class is incredibly difficult. Most of it is done online so you don't really have to attend, but if you do, it's 3 hours of pain from how hard the material is and pain from how irrelevant his discussions are and how he constantly goes off topic. Other than that, just study for the midterm and final and do the term papers. You'll pass",sadness
919,Lectures are irrelevant and very unclear. Exams are extremely difficult and unrelated to homework or lectures. Do not take this class. I got a B but it was the hardest B I ever earned. Take this professor as a last resort,sadness
920,"So confusing. I'm a junior and just received my first C. I highly recommend not taking him. He will give you old tests to study, they are of no use really. The questions on the tests will only resemble them but the actual material will be completely different. Professor Ng, please learn new methods of teaching. Also remember this is a 100lev class.",sadness
921,"I did not learn anything from any of his lectures. He taught us how to get out of a DUI and witch doctors, but nothing about economics what so ever. The tests are impossible because none of the material is covered in any of the lectures. The average test score was a 30%",sadness
922,"It is mandatory to read the book for this class if you even want to pass! Most of his students fail but gives a big curve. Test are hard and confusing and don't resemble the HW. HW & Reading = Easy, Lecture & 3 Tests = Complicated.",sadness
923,"The tests are next to impossible and then extremely curved so that a 50 is an A. I got an A in the class and feel like I learned nothing. Anyone taking his class should be able to pass because of the huge curve. Lectures are vastly irrelevant to economics and at times borderline offensive, like explaining the best way to rob a small asian girl.",sadness
924,"Everyone passes because his grading system, but avoid if you want to learn about economics. His test very difficult and sometimes has information not referenced in class.",sadness
925,"His class is extremely difficult for a beginners Econ class. His lectures are 20% Econ 80% random nonsense. 1 midterm 2 papers 1 final. If you want to do well, read the book till you understand everything, get help from tutoring (even though tutors are just as confused sometimes), do all the homework, STUDY FOR THE QUIZES & study for the exams.",sadness
926,HORRIBLE TEACHER! very hard quizes and exams. he doesnt teach well I sit all the way in the front and I still don't learn because he gets off topic so much... he's   the only professor available for econ 161 next semester but I'm going to a community college just so I won't take him again. makes us read 4 books 1 of the books is over 500 pgs long!!,sadness
927,This class is a simple case of doing better than your peers. Everything is graded based on the whole class average. Do the homework it helps your grade. He makes you read 3 books!smh. 2 term papers on the books. His tests are so hard its ridiculous. Most of the time the average was around 30/100 and im not exaggerating.Take someone else if possible,sadness
928,"He's useless as a teacher but he grades on a curve. So you just have to do better than the rest of the class. Homework is done on Aplia, do it! It's the only way you can learn. (You have to be able to teach yourself the material and Aplia is the best way to do that). Don't get upset if halfway you have an F, grades change dramatically in this class",sadness
929,If u cant teach yourself dont recommend this class his lectures confusing more than anything unless he goes off topic than interesting. Test extremely hard and not related to homework its like math with an essay test doesnt really make sense. Got a 32% on one test and did better than evryone sitting around me. dont recommend.,sadness
930,"I ranked in the top 2% of the class. Only like 5 people got higher grades than me. I studied a lot, read each chapter, did all homeworks and homework problems and still it was difficult. Hardest class ever taken so far in my collegiate career. i recommend taking this class If you hate Obama because you have to write essays about how bad Democrats R",sadness
931,"ok this doosh's class really sucks. his pop-quizzes, all the exams and the final are irrelevant to the lectures. you never use the book. assigns an online HW system, which hes too lazy to give out HW and review anything. the class avg was below 65%. he sucks and he always has a gay ass smirk on his face. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. U WILL REPEAT!!!!!!!",sadness
932,One word: AWFUL! He gives you previous lectures and exams so at first I thought it would be a peice of cake. I was WAY wrong. His lectures are pointless - he usually gets off topic talking about RANDOM things that have NOTHING to do with econ. Never uses book. Writes his own examines and is very objective. Do not take this professor!,sadness
933,"Mr. NG, who hurt you&#63; your real life examples of econic applications are either depressing,or negative.when asked why he put a question on our midterm that wasnt in the material we learned from him he said &quot;because its a thinking class, not a regurtgitating class&quot;.He grades on a curve thank goodness it saved all our butts who were boarderline.",sadness
934,Do not take his class. I cannot think of a more useless professor.,sadness
935,test questions have nothing to do with lectures.  he might know a lot about econ but he is not a teacher.  avoid,sadness
936,the material was very interesting but he needed to slow down.  he did not care about the students.  he never wanted to answer questions and when someone would ask a question he would just give a fast answer and continue with his lecture-lecture was just reading/going over the powerpoints as fast as he could.,sadness
937,"Boring long lectures that have more to do with stupid random examples about gambling, cars, and Fatburger. It's not that hard of a class though, because the curve means a 65 to 70% on the tests = an A. Go to class because he gives out extra credit pop quizes that really help your grade. Do the aplia homework and print out power point slides.",sadness
938,I had this prof. in 1992. I CANNOT believe he hasn't changed. It was the worst class I have ever taken. I am a 4.0 student and he was the only C I have ever received in my life. I am now a teacher and know what good teaching is all about. He is one of the worst teachers I have ever experienced!,sadness
939,"by far the worst teacher. all he do is read the powerpoint. U dont learn anything in his class. if u want to learn, dont ake his class",sadness
940,"GOOD LUCK!  3 tests (including final), and a few extra credit quizzes (you'll need it).  Attendance does not matter, however if you miss quiz day you don't get any extra credit points.  He talks more about random things than he does the material.  Stay at average &quot;standard deviation&quot; and pray for a C.",sadness
941,"The tests are extremely difficult-all graphs with explanation. Huge curve makes it possible to pass, but not with a lack of effort. I found the material impossible to understand, and the lectures very boring!",sadness
942,"Very difficult tests, for he doesn't make clear what he really wants; he is not helpful. The Guy knows his deal but expects the student to be at his level. Aplia doesn't help for the exams. Take him if you have your econ down. The class is interesting.",sadness
943,he was crazy for put the powerpoint.Never interested and so tough exam. Best curve systme that you are able to get C if you get above 30 point out of 100 in any test,sadness
944,"He's to smart to be a teacher, and unfortunately it causes him to teach over our head.",sadness
945,"THIS CLASS COULDNT GET ANY WORSE, STAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS TEACHER",sadness
946,if you don't want to screw up your gpa don't take the online class. This professor sucks... i will not recommend himto anyone. watch out...,sadness
947,Tests are WAY TOO LONG in a short amount of time.. No calculators for simple calculations which really slow you down.  Says &quot;Ok&quot; After Everyother Word which can be REALLY annoying to have to listen to.. Wouldnt Really Recommend Him.. He is nice,sadness
948,"Real difficult. His lectures have nothing to do with his lame, unnecessary difficult tests. If it wasn't for his big curve 80% of the class would have failed. 47 out of 100 was a B for me. Think about it and stay away from this horrible guy.",sadness
949,"the good: funny, works with you every step of the way, gives good feedback.  the bad: blunt and borderline rude (he might be too much if you take criticism personally), semi-disorganized structure of the class (when was that deadline again?), unnecessary lectures (all he does is read off powerpoints).  be ready for independent studying.",sadness
950,"He is nice, but VERY DISORGANIZED. Mid-term NO ONE PASSED! So he let us retake the test  but with open book and in groups. Most of everybody studied for the test, but some questions were not clear and from chapters we haven't even seen or talk in class. He gave us credit for those questions. But I sincerely do not recommend this professor.",sadness
951,Him being funny wears off after a week. I went into this class knowing it was hard & read all the chapters taking extensive notes & got C's on both exams. He curved not because we didn't study but because he messed up. On the 2nd of 3 exams he threw out 10q's because there was no way of us knowing them they literally were not in the booknotes! ,sadness
952,This professor lost 3 out of 6 of my tests. Luckily I had proof of my tests or else I would have gotten an F. Plus he was such a hassle the whole break and almost the whole next semester to change my grade.,sadness
953,"He is funny, but unclear. I had him for 301, a 1-unit class and it felt like a 3-unit class with all the papers that were due. I would not recommend him. Unclear and unreliable.",sadness
954,Dr. Abara is very passionate about his subject but unreliable.  He walks into the 50 minute class 10 minutes late and isn't clear about what is required of the students.  Class is unorganized and he says he will help but doesn't show up to office hours or do what he says he will.,sadness
955,"Dr. Abara is hilarious. He gives really hard exams...I would say impossible exams...but he lets you bring up your grade a lot!! He does not reply to emails, but is nice in class.",sadness
956,"Awful professor, Awful way of teaching, not clear, not nice with students",sadness
957,"He is illogical, Not helpful, extremely hard ( you do not learn any thing) Just unrelated hard master's level material, questions are as complicated as possible! AVOID HIS CLASS!",sadness
958,"Dr. Abara is very anal but he means well, honestly after reading these poor reviews on him i was terrified to go to class but he really was not that bad. His accent is thick and hard to understand. He makes reallly corny jokes and thinks that he is so funny and its exhausting! The material was difficult for me and his tests were extremely hard!",sadness
959,He is an anal retentive and passive aggressive queen. He must be a nightmare as a coworker.Take a valume.,sadness
960,"I do not agree with some of the comments. I got an A and still did not like the way he teaches, plus I did not like the way he treated some students, I saw him being mean to other people and that really bothered me.",sadness
961,"Psychology 402 is a very difficult course. You have to attend every class and you must read the textbook in order to do very well in this class. He is a funny professor and makes you laugh once in awhile but honestly his teaching skills are not so good. In my opinion, when he is teaching he speaks as if you already know the material.",sadness
962,Do not take him!,sadness
963,"He is a nice guy, but never replies to e-mails and does not know how to teach as well as I expected. He also was very mean to a couple of students in class, maybe a little too sarcastic&#63;!",sadness
964,"Not nice. First day of school he acted like a 2 year old who needed a bottle. He is unprofessional, judgmental and course. I would rather eat my arm than finish the course with him. The material is difficult, so having a good guide is essential.",sadness
965,Dr. Abara is an immature and rude professor. &quot;Etiquette of Teaching-101&quot; is what he needs to study! He needs to go back to research and leave teaching to those more qualified. He embarrassed me in class for speaking my honest opinion about why a test mean was 30/50. He'll do it to you! Stay away!,sadness
966,"I have had a great experience at my school, and it all stoped when I met this professor. His moods are all over the place, he is the most unorganized teacher I have ever had.He gets upset if we ask questions and snaps at us. Seriously stay away!!!!",sadness
967,Very confusing! He acts as if you already know the material. Uses powerpoint and flips through them very fast that you can't even write anything down or pay attention to what he is saying. Please avoid taking anything with him. DANGER!,sadness
968,EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CLASS - WARNED NOT TO TAKE!,sadness
969,HORRIBLE PROFESSOR!!! NOT APPROACHABLE AT ALL!!! HE IS VERY INPATIENT AND GETS ANNOYED WITH STUDENTS WHEN THEY ASK QUESTIONS!!! THIS SUBJECT IS ANYTHING BUT EASY!!...DO NOT TAKE HIM!!,sadness
970,This professor needs to be fired,sadness
971,"If you are an A student, you will meet your greatest challenge in his class. Although he seems very generous on the exams, but that's only part of the story. 6 quizes & 5 questions on each, 30% weigh on final grade. Do a little math here: 6x5/30%=1% for each quiz question. 95%&gt;=A 90%&gt;=A-. Missing 2 quizes = bye to an A. And those Questions are HELL",sadness
972,Hard to understand. Can't pronounce certain words. Very confusing when explaining things and rambles on about things that don't make sense.,sadness
973,"One of the rudest professors I have ever met. Does not respect his students, so there is no question to why he has such bad ratings. Though he is smart, he is not cut out for teaching. Avoid taking him as much as possible, it is NOT worth it.",sadness
974,"Nice man, but bad teacher. Unorganized. When he speaks, his words are very unclear and don't make sense in his context. His tests have tons of errors throughout and practically need interpreting before answering them. Most students do poorly in figuring out test questions, so he has to do a lot of grade adjusting (he is VERY generous with curving!)",sadness
975,"I am in his class now, I have a test tomorrow and I don't know what the heck is going to be on the test.  He constantly goes of into tangents. He gives you a useless handouts. Basically he is very very very unclear of what he wants from you. I wich I could drop",sadness
976,"nice professor, knows his materials...yet tests are hard even when effort is put in to studying...course project is do-able and fun...also, he does not like to explain things when question is asked, however likes to talk about random things...not recommended...",sadness
977,"Jose tries very hard to be clear and fair. Unfortunately, he isn't often clear on assignments or what is required to know for tests. He IS helpful if he thinks you're serious and really trying though. For this subject, another prof might be better.",sadness
978,No Comments,sadness
979,"Not good professor. Never gives enough time to copy notes, not concerned over students, always wanting to leave class. would lecture on tardiness and himself was tardy on many occasions, i still failed all midterms and received C, all depends if you try to make an effort to get to talk to him before he rushes out of class",sadness
980,"Not a very good class at all. not clear on notes, never gives enough time to copy notes, never makes himself available to students, always first one to leave class and hates people to stop him for questions. is often late, but scolds others for tardiness. to pass midterms need to read text between lines.  to pass class READ, READ, READ",sadness
981,No Comments,sadness
982,easy to pass although you don't learn anything,sadness
983,"I would have enjoyed the class if he didn't teach it.  Didn't like his teaching skills- was only into what he wanted to tell us regarding his research, not what we needed to learn about abnormal psych. in general. I don't recommend taking him.",sadness
984,"I don't recommend this teacher.  I didn't learn anything.  He is a nice guy, however his emotions are all over the place.  He isn't very organized and his exams are way to hard.",sadness
985,"Unclear of what he wants from you. Everyone failed the first test, but let's you drop lowest test.  Assigned group project with a 10 page paper.",sadness
986,A self teach course. Very moody . Unclear with ALL of his materials. He is very confusing. Spend too much time on the class doing presentations tha are not related to the course. I would not reccommend him. He is a terriable professor how knows his stuff but does not know how to teach.,sadness
987,"teacher is confusing as hell, dont take this if you cherish your sanity.",sadness
988,HORRIBLE.  DO NOT TAKE.  DO NOT TAKE!!!,sadness
989,"I worked very hard in this class and barely pulled a B.  He knows his stuff but does not know anything about teaching.  You take 2-3 pages of notes/day which only covers 30% of test.  The other 70%, good luck.",sadness
990,"Very unclear. Goes off on tangents. Nice guy, but doesn't explain things very well. Relates the topics to things that he finds of interest. Would not recommend.",sadness
991,"He's a nice guy, but geeeeez don't ask him to clarify anything you will just get more confused.",sadness
992,confusing professor to understand.,sadness
993,"Most people who gave this guy a good rating did so becos he came to class and talked about this website. In a way he does suck. As much as u can, avoid Abara. Just not confident and so is he class. His tests are as weird as his class. Just stay away.",sadness
994,"I hated this class. He is not clear, and I dont understand what he says. I learned everything form the book. I studied my whole weekend for his final and I got a B-. Do not take him, he will stress the f!@#$%!! out of you.",sadness
995,"class is boring, gives page number for items that will be on exam, but you have to study to do well in this class, and do reading assignments",sadness
996,No Comments,sadness
997,"She is one of the rudest professors I have ever had. Misunderstand a prompt and all of a sudden she's talking down to you accusing you of not reading a prompt. I'm sorry but I was truly excited for the class, but she ruined it for me. Also, giving projects where we have to run around LA to visit places?No, thanks! College students don't have time !",sadness
998,"Yes, this professor is helpful and does give you much help towards your final and midterm. However, there are weekly essays assigned every week with articles that need to be reads upwards to 20 pages. Which i believe is a lot of work. Definitely tough grader. Large amounts of reading, notes, lectures, videos, and to be honest a lot of rudeness.",sadness
999,"Her attitude most class sessions was very unappealing and made me hate being in the class although I found her lectures interesting. I would recommend looking at other professors, although she does know her stuff, taking her class wasn't the greatest experience.",sadness
1000,"Very hard class. Essays due every week, 6 page mid-term, presentation, and an in class essay. Also she is very picky about grading marks you off for almost anything. She is also not very approachable and treats you like a little kid. You really have to work for a good grade in this class and that may not even be enough.",sadness
1001,"Very hard class, requires lots of work. Though its an online class she makes you go to 2 places and write a 10pg paper, its ridiculous.",sadness
1002,Took this class as filler to maintain full time status and this class contained more work than my previous 10 upper division classes in my major.I worked for A and u will have to work for it. This is not a laid back class but i learned a lot about my own cultural history.,sadness
1003,By far the MOST WORK I've ever had to do for one class. 15k+ words written for the semester. A discussion every week plus essays and semester length research project. She provides NO feedback for written work either. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS TEACHER,sadness
1004,DON'T TAKE HER!!! she only likes it her way and isn't here for the interest of the students! she doesn't help you with your questions on assignments. I always do my assignments but i regret taking her.,sadness
1005,"First Off, do not take her!! She teaches her basic level classes like her upper division courses. she does not help and if you ask a question she makes you feel like you are a foolish child. This is one of the few professors that i will never forget and for all the wrong reasons. She lets her politics and emotions for the subject dictate the class.",sadness
1006,"one word: unapproachable. The course requirements were clearly laid out the first day -no surprises. You must make the commitment to actually read ALL the material and prepare for in class quizzes otherwise, you WILL fail. Expect to read about 20+ pages a week (which is little compared to Upper Division Eng. courses). If you're a good writer and cr",sadness
1007,"Professor uses Course Reader. Did weekly readings and had to turn in a one-two page summary of what we read. Grade is based on two midterms, a final, and a cultural presentation. Lectures were quite lengthy. Group discussions were based on the course reader.",sadness
1008,"Do not take this professor, there is something really wrong with her. I took her for an online class, I had to do 4 major essays, 4 really unclear exams, a 10 page research assignment that requires a visit to her assigned museums, discussion posts every week, 4-5 articles and 2-3 chapters of reading.",sadness
1009,"I hate this teacher. Seriously, her expectations are unrealistic she gives way too many pages to read in one night. She can't answer simple questions. In my opinion she is a very angry person inside and takes it out on her students. She makes me want to cry everyday and quit school, never have I been so uninspired to quit school. She's terrible.",sadness
1010,"Her online class is terrible. She is not clear, the tests are specifically set up to hurt your grade, and she is not thorough in her explanations. For example, she makes typos and she doesn't post quizzes on the correct time she says she will. Not reliable, not learning, and unfun. DO NOT TAKE ONLINE. In person would've been much better",sadness
1011,I have never been so disgusted to have a Professor who completely disregards the fact that she is dealing with adults.  Regardless of the fact some students are there fresh from High School doesn?t mean she has free reign to belittle students intelligence. I hope she learns social skills to go along with her vast knowledge!  Then maybe she may be a,sadness
1012,She is so RUDE and unhelpful. Every other word she says is &quot;right&quot; and she thinks she is so good because she got her P.H.D.  She does not like female students but pays a lot of attention to the guys. The work is pretty easy but there is a lot of reading and she WILL make you look stupid if you don't know the answer. I would not take her again.,sadness
1013,She is very difficult.  Too much writing and too much attitude with it.  Very much into herself and not helpful. Make sure you do the readings if not she will point it out to the whole class.,sadness
1014,"This class could have been a good class but she has a horrible attitude problem. She is mean and demeaning to students. When you answer questions she looks at u like ur stupid. Every other word out of her mouth is &quot;RIGHT&#63;&quot;, UGH!!!Don't take her!!",sadness
1015,"she does have an attitude, but i managed to get B in the class and i didnt read all the material. I also didnt do the oral presentation. The class is easy just try not to miss any lectures, turn in all the journals, and kinda a avoid her cuz shes ****y( she doesnt like to explain her self twice)",sadness
1016,"Really easy grader but a lot of reading. Horrible attitude, which creates an uncomfortable classroom environment.  Do all the reading, write all the journals, do a  5 minute culture presentation, and put up with her annoying attitude and get an A in the class.",sadness
1017,"this teacher is on a high horse about being chicana, all material is female oriented and singles out all the men in the class. treats intro 100 level class way to strict w, too much work. 2 4p papers, oral and a 6 pg in class final for an intro 100 level course&#63;! extremely moody, and offensive",sadness
1018,"this professor is a total b&*#!  she humilates her students and she is not very understanding of their personal problems. &quot;RIGHT&#63;&quot; She marks you tardy if you're late, we are college students here, not high schoolers!!!  She needs to learn some social skills, &quot;RIGHT&#63;&quot;",sadness
1019,"He does not teach! 4 tests, one jeopardy game which is so unfair. His class is only entertaining, you have to read the chapters 3 weeks before the test because its so much reading. I won't recommend. Has a sign in sheet, if you're late by one minute you are considered late. 6 lates equal to 1 absence.",sadness
1020,He is really hard and confusing. He changes topics a lot. Made me hate the class.,sadness
1021,"I had this prof for psy 150 and it was easy, fun and good. I expected the same for 352 but nope. His lectures barely reflect the tests, sure he goes over the book but his questions are so dumb. Maybe 352 is the class he cant really teach, a lot is learned but tests will kill u.",sadness
1022,He's an interesting professor but his tests are HARD. He talks really fast and is known to go off topic all the time. I had him for Motivation and just got by. Take Elias instead.,sadness
1023,"Here is the deal, he is a good professor, IF you do benefit learning from bunch of videos; because i dont!!!! he only talks like 20% of the semester and all 80% he leaves it all on the screen, i can't learn from that way. take him if u can benefit from movies.",sadness
1024,his lecture were unorganized. very hard to understand what section we are discussing. as long as you read the book and study it really well u can do good. his lectures did not help. he is a fun hyper and energetic professor he is nice,sadness
1025,"Professor Gardner speaks very fast and uses very basis vocab and language in his lectures. However, his tests are very hard and uses textbook/professional vocabulary and are not reflected from the lectures. Your grade comes from your tests; no research papers or extra credit opportunities. I would not recommend it unless you're a great test taker.",sadness
1026,"Hard class.  He is all over the map during the lectures.  You will need to use the book to help fill in the gaps because you won't be able to take notes fast enough.  Also, he will say something is not going to be on the test, then it turns up -so study EVERYTHING.  If you have a great memory for details, you will do alright.  Not an easy A.",sadness
1027,"Talks way to fast, swear has ADD, jumps topics a lot.  Hard to focus.  Have to basically read book and borrow notes from others.  Can't record his lectures.  Records attendance before and after.  Paper assignment is included.  He loves subject but not a great teacher.  I have a 3.7 GPA and struggled with this class, this was my only B.",sadness
1028,"Even though I passed the class I can't out of experience possible recommend him to anyone else. He's remarkably impossible to comprehend most of the time and will make your brain have pain even though the brain doesn't have pain receptors.  Maybe he's better when it's not a one day class, but if it is, seriously, don't take him. You won't learn.",sadness
1029,"I think this guy was rated highly because of the group tests he USED 2 give that would boost ur grade. This is the 1st time n 3yrs. That I can safely say I learned nothing. He talks extremely fast, tells u not 2 take  notes, makes u watch videos that aren't avail. n the lib, and the book is useless 4 tests which makeup ur total grade. Learned= nada",sadness
1030,"Very fast talking professor that is unclear at times. I didn't like this class personally, but it depends on the person. He has 4 tests and doesn't believe in midterms or finals. I would rather take this course online if it was offered at the time.",sadness
1031,"The truth must be told. Gardner is an entertaining professor, but that's all. His nice personlaity isn't a good replacement for his unreasonably fast talking habit, his lecturing style that makes note taking almost impossible, his policy on attendance, his disorganize lectures. Good man but has issues when it comes to teaching.",sadness
1032,ya hes funny but that doesnt help for you to get a good grade. he also takes puts off if your absent...,sadness
1033,"I wouldn't take him again. I had to read the book and the tests are very confusing. The 10 page paper that we had to write, weren't even graded fairly. cuz he didn't do it he has a TA doing his stuff. Take my advice, you'll be doing all the work on your own. I didn't pay money for me to only read the book and understand nothing from the lectures.",sadness
1034,The man is a disaster!He's all over the place!His lectures are not clear and I didn't feel like he covered much of the book.,sadness
1035,"He is a VERY HARD TEACHER...he is funny and kept me awake at 8 am mwf but he is very difficult to understand..the tests are very hard and he grades hard to...i have never almost fail a class until i took this one and since i have to take it again, I WILL NOT take it with him...",sadness
1036,"He is definately an energetic professor, but he's not that helpful when it comes to teaching.",sadness
1037,Lectures are horrible- repeat his opinions from them on any test/paper. He isn't receptive to outside insight from students. No feedback on graded work/exams. No handouts/grades posted online so you'll never feel confident in how you're doing in the course. GO TO RECITATION- your TA is your best friend if this guy is your professor.,sadness
1038,"While I enjoyed much of the material covered in this course and loved the readings, this was a VERY DIFFICULT class. Yes, Renzi is arrogant but my frustrations stemmed from his overly particular grading style. You may learn a lot and have interesting theories, but if you dont regurgitate his lectures from class, your grade suffers. Not my style.",sadness
1039,Lectures are well detailed. EXTREMELY difficult readings. A hard grader. isn't clear about what he wants from you. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEXTS AND IDEAS CLASS.,sadness
1040,Vincent Renzi was one of the biggest disappointments that I have had at NYU. Don't take him unless you want to tank your GPA.,sadness
