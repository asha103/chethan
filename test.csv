1,Great prof. He really helps you boost your grades on exams by trying to find ways to give you extra points.Two midterms and final. Makes the final so easy that its impossible ,neutral
2,"Best Professor on the whole campus! You will feel confident that you learned the material.  Excellent presentation, thank you for inspiring me in the field of Psychology!",neutral
3,"He is funny and makes us laugh, and always makes jokes. He is also very helpful. He is really a great professor! Scandilish! Just do your best and you will do just fine.",neutral
4,"Very detailed on every aspect that he teaches. Tests will definitely test you. Fun class, makes it interesting. 3 tests, Group test for number 2. Must take notes to pass class material is not usually in the book. Ask him if you can help in his research. Everything on test was covered in lecture and he is very clear about that.",neutral
5,confusing professor to understand.,worry
6,"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take ",worry
7,"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  ",worry
8,one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long ,worry
9,cause of him.. only like 3 points different from making my grade one level higher in the class he dropped my gpa a huge amount and wouldnt budge at all.. NOT COOL AT ALL.. and can you say boring,worry
10,Hardest class I've ever taken.  Web assign assignments took me hours to complete because I had to teach myself the stuff that he was supposed to teach me.  Boring lectures ,sadness
11,"Even though I passed the class I can't out of experience possible recommend him to anyone else. He's remarkably impossible to comprehend most of the time and will make your brain have pain even though the brain doesn't have pain receptors.  Maybe he's better when it's not a one day class, but if it is, seriously, don't take him. You won't learn.",sadness
12,I think this guy was rated highly because of the group tests he USED 2 give that would boost ur grade. This is the 1st time n 3yrs. That I can safely say I learned nothing. He talks ,sadness
13,"lectures, turn in all the journals, and kinda a avoid her cuz shes ****y( she doesnt like to explain her self twice)",sadness
14,"Very fast talking professor that is unclear at times. I didn't like this class personally, but it depends on the person. He has 4 tests and doesn't believe in midterms or finals. I would rather take this course online if it was offered at the time.",worry
15,"Professor Gardner is incredibly enthusiastic during his lectures making it easy to stay focused. He also has a great way of breaking down the concepts taught, making it easier to understand. His exams are fairly easy, whatever is mentioned in class is most likely to be seen on the exam along w/ some stuff from the readings! He's a great guy!",neutral
16,"Gardner is amazing, there's no other way to put it. He's hilarious, kind, entertaining, knowledgeable, and really understands his students. Best professor I've ever had! We only had 4 exams /semester and no final. I always looked forward to being in class, I knew I was going to have a great time laughing and learning fascinating concepts. Take him!",neutral
17,"He is probably one of the best professors I have ever had so far. He mixes humor and learning, which makes the info a little bit easier to digest and remember. He doesn't do a final, which is nice. His tests are okay and straightforward as long as you at least try to learn the lesson.",neutral
18,His class is one of the best I've taken! There is no homework although he does tells you which pages to read from the textbook to learn more about his lecture. Tests are easier than expected and his lectures are really fun!,neutral
19,"Best PSYCH Teacher ever!!! He is so nice, funny, awesome, and amazing! He should be an actor! His lectures are very interesting, his class is so much fun. And plus you will learn a lot in his class! No homework, just 4 tests. But you still have to study. But he always tells u wat to read and sections will be in the test! Highly recommend",neutral
